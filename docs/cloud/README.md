# Welcome to Craft Cloud

Craft Cloud is our very own serverless hosting platform. We designed it from the ground-up to be the best way to launch and scale your Craft project.

<See url="https://craftcms.com/cloud" label="Craft Cloud" description="Take a tour of Cloudâ€™s main features." />

You can [get started](getting-started.md) on Cloud by deploying a new or existing project with a free seven-day trial.

This section covers everything from [initial configuration](config.md) to [launch-day preparation](launch-checklist.md), as well as Craft features that let you make the most of the platform.

Psst! Were you redirected here from the [Knowledge Base](https://craftcms.com/knowledge-base)? We recently merged all Cloud resources into the main docs site so you can learn about all our products in the same space.
