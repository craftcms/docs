# Queue Jobs

Craft uses a queue for processing background tasks like updating indexes, propagating entries, and pruning revisions. You can write simple queue job classes to register your asynchronous queue tasks.

This feature relies on [Yii‚Äôs queue system](https://www.yiiframework.com/extension/yiisoft/yii2-queue/doc/guide/2.0/en/usage), to which Craft adds a [BaseJob](craft5:craft\queue\BaseJob) class for some perks:

- The ability to set a fallback description for the job.
- The ability to label and report task progress for a better user experience.

## To Queue or Not to Queue

An ideal queue job is something slow that the a user shouldn‚Äôt have to wait on while using a site‚Äôs front end or the control panel. Multi-step processes and actions that connect with third-party APIs can be ideal candidates for queueing.

Critical tasks, however, should not necessarily be entrusted to the queue. A default Craft install will have <config5:runQueueAutomatically> enabled and be reliant on a control panel browser session to trigger the queue. This could result in queue processing delays for infrequently-accessed sites.

Similarly, failed queue jobs may pause the queue and require admin intervention. Both are worth considering as you‚Äôre contemplating whether or not to utilize a queue job for your plugin or custom module.

## Writing a Job

You can add your own queue job by first writing a class that extends <craft5:craft\queue\BaseJob> and implements `execute()`.

This example class sends an email:

```php
<?php

namespace modules\jobs;

use Craft;
use craft\mail\Message;

class MyJob extends \craft\queue\BaseJob
{
    public function execute($queue): void
    {
        $message = new Message();

        $message->setTo('to@domain.tld');
        $message->setSubject('Oh Hai');
        $message->setTextBody('Hello from the queue system! üëã');

        Craft::$app->getMailer()->send($message);
    }

    protected function defaultDescription(): string
    {
        return Craft::t('app', 'Sending a worthless email');
    }
}
```

### Updating Progress

If your job involves multiple steps, you might want to report its progress while it‚Äôs executing.

You can do this with BaseJob‚Äôs [`setProgress()`](craft5:craft\queue\BaseJob::setProgress()) method, whose arguments are:

- the queue instance
- a number between 0 and 1 representing the percent complete
- an optional, human-friendly label describing the progress

We can modify our example `execute()` method to send an email to every Craft user and report the job‚Äôs progress.

::: danger
Do not lightheartedly send an email to every Craft user. Not cool.
:::

```php{7-14}
public function execute($queue): void
{
    $users = \craft\elements\User::findAll();
    $totalUsers = count($users);

    foreach ($users as $i => $user) {
        $this->setProgress(
            $queue,
            $i / $totalUsers,
            Craft::t('app', '{step, number} of {total, number}', [
                'step' => $i + 1,
                'total' => $totalUsers,
            ])
        );

        $message = new Message();

        $message->setTo($user->email);
        $message->setSubject('Oh Hai');
        $message->setTextBody('Hello from the queue system! üëã');

        // Swallow exceptions from the mailer:
        try {
            Craft::$app->getMailer()->send($message);
        } catch (\Throwable $e) {
            Craft::warning("Something went wrong: {$e->getMessage()}", __METHOD__);
        }
    }
}
```

### Dealing with Failed Jobs

In our first example, exceptions from the mailer can bubble out of our job‚Äîbut in the second example, we catch those errors so the job is not halted prematurely.

This decision is up to you: if the work in a job is nonessential (or will be done again later, like <craft5:craft\queue\jobs\GeneratePendingTransforms>), you can catch and log errors and let the job end nominally; if the work is critical (like synchronizing something to an external API), it may be better to let the exception bubble out of `execute()`.

The queue wraps every job in its own `try` block, and will mark any jobs that throw exceptions as _failed_. The exception message that caused the failure will be recorded along with the job. Failed jobs can be retried from the control panel or with the `php craft queue/retry [id]` command.

#### Retryable Jobs

The queue will automatically retry failed jobs that implement the [`RetryableJobInterface`](https://www.yiiframework.com/extension/yiisoft/yii2-queue/doc/guide/2.0/en/retryable#retryablejobinterface). A job will only be retried after its `ttr` has passed‚Äîeven if it didn‚Äôt use up the allowed time, and will be marked as failed once `canRetry()` returns false.

::: warning
Returning `true` from `canRetry()` can pollute your queue with jobs that may never succeed. Failed jobs are not necessarily bad! Exceptions can be used to track failures in code that runs unattended.
:::

### Batched Jobs

In situations where there is simply too much work to do in a single request (or within PHP‚Äôs memory limit), consider extending <craft5:craft\queue\BaseBatchedJob>.

Batched jobs‚Äô `execute()` method is handled for you. Instead, you must define two new methods:

- `loadData()` ‚Äî Returns a class implementing <craft5:craft\base\Batchable>, like <craft5:craft\db\QueryBatcher>. Data is not necessarily loaded at this point, but a means of fetching data in ‚Äúslices‚Äù must be.
- `processItem($item)` ‚Äî Your logic for handling a single item in each batch.

::: tip
<craft5:craft\db\QueryBatcher> can be passed any <craft5:craft\db\Query> subclass, including element queries. Use it to wrap queries returned from `loadData()`:

```php
use craft\db\QueryBatcher;
use craft\elements\Asset;

$query = Asset::find()
    ->volume('whitepapers')
    ->orderBy('id ASC');

return new QueryBatcher($query);
```

Also note that we‚Äôre explicitly ordering by `id`‚Äîthis can help avoid skipped or double-processed items across batches when the underlying data changes (including changes made _within a job_)!
:::

Batched jobs can also define a default `$batchSize` that is appropriate for the workload. The batch size is not a guaranteed value, but a target when Craft spawns the next job‚Äîit will keep track of memory usage and _may_ stop short, scheduling the next batch to resume where it left off.

::: warning
Batched jobs **must** be pushed using <craft5:craft\helpers\Queue::push()>, or `delay` and `ttr` settings may be lost for subsequent batches.
:::

## Adding Your Job to the Queue

Once you‚Äôve created your job, you can add it to the queue:

```php
use mynamespace\queue\jobs\MyJob;

\craft\helpers\Queue::push(new MyJob());
```

You can do this wherever it makes sense‚Äîmost likely in a controller action or service.

### Specifying Priority

You can specify priority when pushing a job by passing an integer in a second argument:

```php
use mynamespace\queue\jobs\MyJob;

\craft\helpers\Queue::push(new MyJob(), 10);
```

The default priority is `1024`, and jobs with a lower priority are executed first.

Not all queue drivers support setting a priority; `Queue::push()` will attempt to set it and fall back to pushing without a priority if the driver throws a `NotSupportedException`.
