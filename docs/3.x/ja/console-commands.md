# Console Commands

While most of your interaction with Craft happens in a browser, a number of important tools are available via console commands that are run in a terminal.

This can be useful for a variety of reasons, including automating tasks with `cron`, privately triggering actions via SSH or as part of a deployment process, or running resource-intensive tasks that might be constrained by the limits of your web server.

The Craft console application lives in the root of your project (`craft` for Mac/Linux, `craft.bat` for Windows) and requires PHP to run.

::: warning
You may need to configure your environment in order to run PHP from your terminal; `php-fpm` and `mod_php` are meant to run with a web server while `php-cli` is a separate process for the command line.
:::

Running the `craft` console command without any arguments will output a complete list of available options. (This will include any console commands added by plugins or custom modules.)
