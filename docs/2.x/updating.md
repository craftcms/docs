# Updating

## One-click Updating

When an update is available, users with the permission to update Craft will see a badge in the control panel header. Clicking on that badge will take you to a page that shows the release notes of all the available updates.

You can get to that page at any time by clicking the “Check for updates” link in the control panel footer as well. Whenever you go to the page, whether Craft thinks updates are available or not, the page will clear its cache and re-check for available updates.

At the top of the page there is an “Update” button. Clicking that will initiate Craft’s self-updating process.

For one-click updates to work, your craft/app folder and all its enclosed files and folders must be writable. The exact permissions you should use depend on the relationship between the user that Apache/PHP is running as and the user who actually owns the craft/config folder.

Here are some recommended permissions depending on that relationship:

* If they are the same user, use `744`.
* If they’re in the same group, then use `774`.
* Otherwise, use `777`.


## Manually Updating

You can download the latest release in the format you prefer to work with by following the instructions in [this article](kb:downloading-previous-craft-versions).

Or click the menu button beside your “Update” button on the Updates page of your control panel, which will give you the zip file.

When the archive has finished downloading, you can manually update your Craft install by replacing the old `craft/app/` folder with the new one.

If you’re manually updating a live site, we recommend you follow these instructions to minimize your site’s down time:

1. Rename the `craft/app/` folder in the release to `app-new/`.
2. Upload `craft/app-new/` to the craft folder on your server, alongside the old `craft/app/` folder.
3. Once `app-new/` is done uploading, your FTP client may have uploaded the `app-new/` folder with different permissions that what your `craft/app/` folder currently has. If so, make sure app-new matches what `craft/app/` currently has.
4. Rename the old `craft/app/` folder to `craft/app-old/`.
5. Rename `app-new/` to `app/`.
6. Point your browser to your Craft control panel. If the update needs to run any new database migrations, you will be prompted to proceed with a database update. Click “Finish up” and let the database updates run.
7. Delete the `app-old/` folder.
