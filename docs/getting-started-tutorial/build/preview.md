# Live Preview

Now that we have a full suite of templates (and enough CSS to make sense of our content), head back into the control panel and click the **Preview** button on any of your blog posts. Craft will split the view between a simplified editing UI on the left and a live preview on the right:

<BrowserShot url="https://tutorial.ddev.site/admin/entries/blog/20-my-trip-to-bend" :link="false" caption="Editing a blog post with live preview.">
<img src="../images/live-preview.png" alt="Screenshot of control panel editing a post with live preview: content on the left and a front end preview on the right" />
</BrowserShot>

As you make edits in the content pane, Craft auto-saves the changes and refreshes the front-end preview. You can save your changes at any time, knowing that what you see is exactly what will be published!
