#### `language`

<a class="ref-defined-by" href="https://docs.craftcms.com/api/v5/craft-elements-db-elementquery.html#method-language" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">Defined by <code>craft\elements\db\ElementQuery</code></a>

::: code
```twig
{# Fetch assets from English sites #}
{% set assets = craft.assets()
  .language('en')
  .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch assets from English sites
$assets = \craft\elements\Asset::find()

Determines the number of assets that should be returned.



::: code
```twig

See [Relations](https://craftcms.com/docs/5.x/system/relations.html) for a full explanation of how to work with this parameter.



::: code
```twig
{# Fetch all assets that are related to myEntry #}
{% set assets = craft.assets()

{% set assets = craft.assets()
  .orderBy('dateCreated ASC')

If [unique](#unique) is set, this determines which site should be selected when querying multi-site elements.



For example, if element “Foo” exists in Site A and Site B, and element “Bar” exists in Site B and Site C,
and this is set to `['c', 'b', 'a']`, then Foo will be returned for Site B, and Bar will be returned
for Site C.

If this isn’t set, then preference goes to the current site.



::: code
```twig
{# Fetch unique assets from Site A, or Site B if they don’t exist in Site A #}
{% set assets = craft.assets()
  .site('*')
  .unique()
  .preferSites(['a', 'b'])
  .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch unique assets from Site A, or Site B if they don’t exist in Site A
$assets = \craft\elements\Asset::find()
    ->site('*')
    ->unique()

Causes the query to return matching assets eager-loaded with related elements.



See [Eager-Loading Elements](https://craftcms.com/docs/5.x/development/eager-loading.html) for a full explanation of how to work with this parameter.



::: code
```twig
{# Fetch assets eager-loaded with the "Related" field’s relations #}
{% set assets = craft.assets()
  .with(['related'])
  .all() %}
```

:::


#### `withCustomFields`

<a class="ref-defined-by" href="https://docs.craftcms.com/api/v5/craft-elements-db-elementquery.html#method-withcustomfields" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">Defined by <code>craft\elements\db\ElementQuery</code></a>

#### `withProvisionalDrafts`

<a class="ref-defined-by" href="https://docs.craftcms.com/api/v5/craft-elements-db-elementquery.html#method-withprovisionaldrafts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">Defined by <code>craft\elements\db\ElementQuery</code></a>

Causes the query to return provisional drafts for the matching elements,
when they exist for the current user.










#### `withTransforms`


Causes the query to return matching assets eager-loaded with image transform indexes.

This can improve performance when displaying several image transforms at once, if the transforms
have already been generated.

Transforms can be specified as their handle or an object that contains `width` and/or `height` properties.

You can include `srcset`-style sizes (e.g. `100w` or `2x`) following a normal transform definition, for example:

::: code

```twig
[{width: 1000, height: 600}, '1.5x', '2x', '3x']
```

```php
[['width' => 1000, 'height' => 600], '1.5x', '2x', '3x']
```

:::

When a `srcset`-style size is encountered, the preceding normal transform definition will be used as a
reference when determining the resulting transform dimensions.



::: code
```twig
{# Fetch assets with the 'thumbnail' and 'hiResThumbnail' transform data preloaded #}
{% set assets = craft.assets()
  .kind('image')
  .withTransforms(['thumbnail', 'hiResThumbnail'])
  .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch assets with the 'thumbnail' and 'hiResThumbnail' transform data preloaded
$assets = \craft\elements\Asset::find()
    ->kind('image')
    ->withTransforms(['thumbnail', 'hiResThumbnail'])
    ->all();
```
