# Working with Clients

Craft Cloud is part of Craft Console, so features that support teams like multi-user [organizations](/knowledge-base/craft-console-organizations) and access control are built in:

- As a *developer* or agency, you can create organizations and projects on behalf of clients;
- As a *client*, you can invite your development partner to an organization and let them configure a project;

Either way, taking advantage of organizations is key to collaborating on Cloud.

Our [Managing a Craft Cloud Project](management.md) article covers the project lifecycle in greater detail.

## Payment Methods

An organization’s owner is responsible for maintaining its payment methods. A valid payment method is required to start a Cloud project; whenever a monthly or yearly bill is due, the organization’s primary payment method is automatically charged.

Organization owners will be notified if there are [billing issues](billing.md) any of its Cloud projects.

## Transferring Projects

Currently, Cloud projects cannot be transferred between organizations, or between personal accounts and organizations.
