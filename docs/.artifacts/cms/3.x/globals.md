Possible values include:

| Value | Fetches global sets…
| - | -
| `'>= 2018-04-01'` | that were created on or after 2018-04-01.

| `['and', '>= 2018-04-04', '< 2018-05-01']` | that were created between 2018-04-01 and 2018-05-01.



::: code
```twig
{# Fetch global sets created last month #}

$globalSets = \craft\elements\GlobalSet::find()
    ->dateUpdated(">= {$lastWeek}")
    ->all();
```
:::


#### `fixedOrder`

Causes the query results to be returned in the order specified by [id](#id).



::: tip
If no IDs were passed to [id](#id), setting this to `true` will result in an empty result set.
:::



::: code
```twig
{# Fetch global sets in a specific order #}
{% set globalSets = craft.globalSets()
  .id([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
  .fixedOrder()

| `[1, 2]` | with an ID of 1 or 2.
| `['not', 1, 2]` | not with an ID of 1 or 2.



::: code
```twig
{# Fetch the global set by its ID #}
{% set globalSet = craft.globalSets()
  .id(1)
  .one() %}
```

```php
// Fetch the global set by its ID
$globalSet = \craft\elements\GlobalSet::find()
    ->id(1)
    ->one();
```
:::



::: tip
This can be combined with [fixedOrder](#fixedorder) if you want the results to be returned in a specific order.
:::


#### `ignorePlaceholders`

Causes the query to return matching global sets as they are stored in the database, ignoring matching placeholder
elements that were set by [craft\services\Elements::setPlaceholderElement()](https://docs.craftcms.com/api/v3/craft-services-elements.html#method-setplaceholderelement).










#### `inReverse`

Causes the query results to be returned in reverse order.

    ->all();
```
:::


#### `offset`

Determines how many global sets should be skipped in the results.



::: code
```twig
{# Fetch all global sets except for the first 3 #}
{% set globalSets = craft.globalSets()
  .offset(3)
  .all() %}
```

```php

$globalSets = \craft\elements\GlobalSet::find()
    ->offset(3)
    ->all();
```
:::


#### `orderBy`

Determines the order that the global sets should be returned in. (If empty, defaults to `name ASC`.)



::: code
```twig
{# Fetch all global sets in order of date created #}
{% set globalSets = craft.globalSets()
  .orderBy('dateCreated ASC')
  .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch all global sets in order of date created
$globalSets = \craft\elements\GlobalSet::find()
    ->orderBy('dateCreated ASC')
    ->all();
```
:::


#### `preferSites`

If [unique](#unique) is set, this determines which site should be selected when querying multi-site elements.



For example, if element “Foo” exists in Site A and Site B, and element “Bar” exists in Site B and Site C,
and this is set to `['c', 'b', 'a']`, then Foo will be returned for Site B, and Bar will be returned
for Site C.

If this isn’t set, then preference goes to the current site.



::: code
```twig
{# Fetch unique global sets from Site A, or Site B if they don’t exist in Site A #}
{% set globalSets = craft.globalSets()
  .site('*')
  .unique()
  .preferSites(['a', 'b'])
  .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch unique global sets from Site A, or Site B if they don’t exist in Site A
$globalSets = \craft\elements\GlobalSet::find()
    ->site('*')
    ->unique()
    ->preferSites(['a', 'b'])
    ->all();
```
:::


#### `relatedTo`

Narrows the query results to only global sets that are related to certain other elements.



See [Relations](https://craftcms.com/docs/3.x/relations.html) for a full explanation of how to work with this parameter.



::: code
```twig
{# Fetch all global sets that are related to myCategory #}
{% set globalSets = craft.globalSets()
  .relatedTo(myCategory)
  .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch all global sets that are related to $myCategory
$globalSets = \craft\elements\GlobalSet::find()
    ->relatedTo($myCategory)
    ->all();
```
:::


#### `search`

Narrows the query results to only global sets that match a search query.



See [Searching](https://craftcms.com/docs/3.x/searching.html) for a full explanation of how to work with this parameter.



::: code
```twig
{# Get the search query from the 'q' query string param #}
{% set searchQuery = craft.app.request.getQueryParam('q') %}

{# Fetch all global sets that match the search query #}
{% set globalSets = craft.globalSets()
  .search(searchQuery)
  .all() %}
```

```php
// Get the search query from the 'q' query string param
$searchQuery = \Craft::$app->request->getQueryParam('q');

// Fetch all global sets that match the search query
$globalSets = \craft\elements\GlobalSet::find()
    ->search($searchQuery)
    ->all();
```
:::


#### `site`

Determines which site(s) the global sets should be queried in.



The current site will be used by default.

Possible values include:

| Value | Fetches global sets…
| - | -
| `'foo'` | from the site with a handle of `foo`.
| `['foo', 'bar']` | from a site with a handle of `foo` or `bar`.
| `['not', 'foo', 'bar']` | not in a site with a handle of `foo` or `bar`.
| a [craft\models\Site](craft3:craft\models\Site) object | from the site represented by the object.
| `'*'` | from any site.

::: tip
If multiple sites are specified, elements that belong to multiple sites will be returned multiple times. If you
only want unique elements to be returned, use [unique](#unique) in conjunction with this.
:::



::: code
```twig
{# Fetch global sets from the Foo site #}
{% set globalSets = craft.globalSets()
  .site('foo')
  .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch global sets from the Foo site
$globalSets = \craft\elements\GlobalSet::find()
    ->site('foo')
    ->all();
```
:::


#### `siteId`

Determines which site(s) the global sets should be queried in, per the site’s ID.



The current site will be used by default.

Possible values include:

| - | -
| `1` | from the site with an ID of `1`.
| `[1, 2]` | from a site with an ID of `1` or `2`.
| `['not', 1, 2]` | not in a site with an ID of `1` or `2`.
| `'*'` | from any site.



::: code
```twig
{# Fetch global sets from the site with an ID of 1 #}
{% set globalSets = craft.globalSets()
  .siteId(1)
  .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch global sets from the site with an ID of 1
$globalSets = \craft\elements\GlobalSet::find()
    ->siteId(1)
    ->all();
```
:::


#### `siteSettingsId`

Narrows the query results based on the global sets’ IDs in the `elements_sites` table.



Possible values include:

| Value | Fetches global sets…
| - | -
| `1` | with an `elements_sites` ID of 1.
| `'not 1'` | not with an `elements_sites` ID of 1.
| `[1, 2]` | with an `elements_sites` ID of 1 or 2.
| `['not', 1, 2]` | not with an `elements_sites` ID of 1 or 2.



::: code
```twig
{# Fetch the global set by its ID in the elements_sites table #}
{% set globalSet = craft.globalSets()
  .siteSettingsId(1)
  .one() %}
```

```php
// Fetch the global set by its ID in the elements_sites table
$globalSet = \craft\elements\GlobalSet::find()
    ->siteSettingsId(1)
    ->one();
```
:::


#### `trashed`

::: code
```twig
{# Fetch trashed global sets #}
{% set globalSets = craft.globalSets()
  .trashed()
  .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch trashed global sets
$globalSets = \craft\elements\GlobalSet::find()
    ->trashed()
    ->all();
```
:::


#### `uid`

Narrows the query results based on the global sets’ UIDs.





::: code
```twig
{# Fetch the global set by its UID #}
{% set globalSet = craft.globalSets()
  .uid('xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx')
  .one() %}
```

```php
// Fetch the global set by its UID
$globalSet = \craft\elements\GlobalSet::find()
    ->uid('xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx')
    ->one();
```
:::


#### `unique`

Determines whether only elements with unique IDs should be returned by the query.



This should be used when querying elements from multiple sites at the same time, if “duplicate” results is not
desired.



::: code
```twig
{# Fetch unique global sets across all sites #}
{% set globalSets = craft.globalSets()
  .site('*')
  .unique()
  .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch unique global sets across all sites
$globalSets = \craft\elements\GlobalSet::find()
    ->site('*')
    ->unique()
    ->all();
```
:::


#### `with`

Causes the query to return matching global sets eager-loaded with related elements.



See [Eager-Loading Elements](https://craftcms.com/docs/3.x/dev/eager-loading-elements.html) for a full explanation of how to work with this parameter.



::: code
```twig
{# Fetch global sets eager-loaded with the "Related" field’s relations #}
{% set globalSets = craft.globalSets()
  .with(['related'])
  .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch global sets eager-loaded with the "Related" field’s relations
$globalSets = \craft\elements\GlobalSet::find()
    ->with(['related'])
    ->all();
```
