For example, if element “Foo” exists in Site A and Site B, and element “Bar” exists in Site B and Site C,
and this is set to `['c', 'b', 'a']`, then Foo will be returned for Site B, and Bar will be returned
for Site C.

If this isn’t set, then preference goes to the current site.

{% set assets = craft.assets()
  .site('*')
  .unique()
  .preferSites(['a', 'b'])
  .all() %}

  .search(searchQuery)
  .all() %}
```

```php
// Get the search query from the 'q' query string param
$searchQuery = \Craft::$app->request->getQueryParam('q');

// Fetch all assets that match the search query
$assets = \craft\elements\Asset::find()
    ->search($searchQuery)
    ->all();
```

```

```php
// Fetch assets with a title that contains "Foo"
$assets = \craft\elements\Asset::find()
    ->title('*Foo*')
    ->all();
```
:::


#### `trashed`

Narrows the query results to only assets that have been soft-deleted.





::: code
```twig
{# Fetch trashed assets #}
{% set assets = craft.assets()
  .trashed()
  .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch trashed assets
$assets = \craft\elements\Asset::find()
    ->trashed()
    ->all();
```
:::


#### `uid`

Narrows the query results based on the assets’ UIDs.





::: code
```twig
{# Fetch the asset by its UID #}
{% set asset = craft.assets()
  .uid('xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx')
  .one() %}
```

```php
// Fetch the asset by its UID
$asset = \craft\elements\Asset::find()
    ->uid('xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx')
    ->one();
```
:::


#### `unique`

Determines whether only elements with unique IDs should be returned by the query.



This should be used when querying elements from multiple sites at the same time, if “duplicate” results is not
desired.



::: code
```twig
{# Fetch unique assets across all sites #}
{% set assets = craft.assets()
  .site('*')
  .unique()
  .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch unique assets across all sites
$assets = \craft\elements\Asset::find()
    ->site('*')
    ->unique()
    ->all();
```
:::


#### `uploader`

Narrows the query results based on the user the assets were uploaded by, per the user’s IDs.

Possible values include:

| Value | Fetches assets…
| - | -
| `1` | uploaded by the user with an ID of 1.
| a [craft\elements\User](craft3:craft\elements\User) object | uploaded by the user represented by the object.



::: code
```twig
{# Fetch assets uploaded by the user with an ID of 1 #}
{% set assets = craft.assets()
  .uploader(1)
  .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch assets uploaded by the user with an ID of 1
$assets = \craft\elements\Asset::find()
    ->uploader(1)
    ->all();
```
:::


#### `volume`

Narrows the query results based on the volume the assets belong to.

Possible values include:

| Value | Fetches assets…
| - | -
| `'foo'` | in a volume with a handle of `foo`.
| `'not foo'` | not in a volume with a handle of `foo`.
| `['foo', 'bar']` | in a volume with a handle of `foo` or `bar`.
| `['not', 'foo', 'bar']` | not in a volume with a handle of `foo` or `bar`.
| a [volume](craft3:craft\base\VolumeInterface) object | in a volume represented by the object.



::: code
```twig
{# Fetch assets in the Foo volume #}
{% set assets = craft.assets()
  .volume('foo')
  .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch assets in the Foo group
$assets = \craft\elements\Asset::find()
    ->volume('foo')
    ->all();
```
:::


#### `volumeId`

Narrows the query results based on the volumes the assets belong to, per the volumes’ IDs.

Possible values include:

| Value | Fetches assets…
| - | -
| `1` | in a volume with an ID of 1.
| `'not 1'` | not in a volume with an ID of 1.
| `[1, 2]` | in a volume with an ID of 1 or 2.
| `['not', 1, 2]` | not in a volume with an ID of 1 or 2.
| `':empty:'` | that haven’t been stored in a volume yet



::: code
```twig
{# Fetch assets in the volume with an ID of 1 #}
{% set assets = craft.assets()
  .volumeId(1)
  .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch assets in the volume with an ID of 1
$assets = \craft\elements\Asset::find()
    ->volumeId(1)
    ->all();
```
:::


#### `width`

Narrows the query results based on the assets’ image widths.

Possible values include:

| Value | Fetches assets…
| - | -
| `100` | with a width of 100.
| `'>= 100'` | with a width of at least 100.
| `['>= 100', '<= 1000']` | with a width between 100 and 1,000.



::: code
```twig
{# Fetch XL images #}
{% set assets = craft.assets()
  .kind('image')
  .width('>= 1000')
  .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch XL images
$assets = \craft\elements\Asset::find()
    ->kind('image')
    ->width('>= 1000')
    ->all();
```
:::


#### `with`

Causes the query to return matching assets eager-loaded with related elements.



See [Eager-Loading Elements](https://craftcms.com/docs/3.x/dev/eager-loading-elements.html) for a full explanation of how to work with this parameter.



::: code
```twig
{# Fetch assets eager-loaded with the "Related" field’s relations #}
{% set assets = craft.assets()
  .with(['related'])
  .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch assets eager-loaded with the "Related" field’s relations
$assets = \craft\elements\Asset::find()
    ->with(['related'])
    ->all();
```
:::


#### `withTransforms`

Causes the query to return matching assets eager-loaded with image transform indexes.

This can improve performance when displaying several image transforms at once, if the transforms
have already been generated.

Transforms can be specified as their handle or an object that contains `width` and/or `height` properties.

You can include `srcset`-style sizes (e.g. `100w` or `2x`) following a normal transform definition, for example:

::: code

```twig
[{width: 1000, height: 600}, '1.5x', '2x', '3x']
```

```php
[['width' => 1000, 'height' => 600], '1.5x', '2x', '3x']
```

:::

When a `srcset`-style size is encountered, the preceding normal transform definition will be used as a
reference when determining the resulting transform dimensions.



::: code
```twig
{# Fetch assets with the 'thumbnail' and 'hiResThumbnail' transform data preloaded #}
{% set assets = craft.assets()
  .kind('image')
  .withTransforms(['thumbnail', 'hiResThumbnail'])
  .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch assets with the 'thumbnail' and 'hiResThumbnail' transform data preloaded
$assets = \craft\elements\Asset::find()
    ->kind('image')
    ->withTransforms(['thumbnail', 'hiResThumbnail'])
    ->all();
```
