# GraphQL API <badge type="edition" vertical="middle" title="Craft has GraphQL result caching enabled by default, but it can be disabled with the <a href="https://docs.craftcms.com/api/v3/craft-config-generalconfig.html#enablegraphqlcaching">enableGraphQlCaching</a> config setting.">draftOf</badge>

Craft Pro provides an autogenerated [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) API for your content, which you can query to pull your content into separate applications, such as single-page apps (SPAs) or static site generators.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure that you’re running Craft Pro 3.3 or later and [the `enableGql` setting](config3:enableGql) has not been set to `false`.

Because GraphQL is self-documenting, you can jump right into Craft’s included [GraphiQL IDE](#using-the-graphiql-ide) from the control panel and interactively build and execute queries. Querying from the control panel gives you full access to data that’s available, unlike queries from the outside that require [an endpoint and appropriate permissions](#setting-up-your-api-endpoint).

## Let's look at an example.

### Query payload

Here’s what a [query](#query-reference) for two news entries might look like, complete with a formatted `dateCreated` and custom-transformed `featureImage`:

You can verify that your endpoint is configured correctly, try sending a `{ping}` query to it.
```graphql GraphQL
{
  entries (section: "news", limit: 2, orderBy: "dateCreated DESC") {
    dateCreated @formatDateTime (format: "Y-m-d")
    title
    children {
      title
    }
    ... on news_article_Entry {
      shortDescription
      featuredImage {
        url @transform (width: 300, immediately: true)
      }
    }
  }
}
```
```json JSON Response
{
  "data": {
    "entries": [
      {
        "dateCreated": "2019-08-21",
        "title": "An important news item",
        "children": [],
        "shortDescription": "<p>This is how we roll these days.</p>",
        "featuredImage": [
          {
            "url": "/assets/site/_300xAUTO_crop_center-center_none/glasses.jpg"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "dateCreated": "2019-07-02",
        "title": "Dolorem ea eveniet alias",
        "children": [
          {
            "title": "Child entry"
          },
          {
            "title": "This is also a child entry"
          }
        ],
        "shortDescription": "Et omnis explicabo iusto eum nobis. Consequatur debitis architecto est exercitationem vitae velit repellendus. Aut consequatur maiores error ducimus ea et. Rem ipsa asperiores eius quas et omnis. Veniam quasi qui repellendus dignissimos et necessitatibus. Aut a illo tempora.",
        "featuredImage": []
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### The response

If that comes back with the following JSON response, then your GraphQL API is up and running!

::: code
```graphql GraphQL
mutation saveEntry($title: String, $slug: String) {
  save_news_article_Entry(title: $title, slug: $slug) {
    title
    slug
    dateCreated @formatDateTime (format: "Y-m-d")
  }
}

# query variables:
{
  "title": "Craft 3.5 Supports GraphQL Mutations",
  "slug": "craft-graphql-mutations"
}
```
```json JSON Response
{
  "data": {
    "save_news_article_Entry": {
      "title": "Craft 3.5 Supports GraphQL Mutations",
      "slug": "craft-graphql-mutations",
      "dateCreated": "2020-04-18"
    }
  }
}
```

## Setting Up Your API Endpoint

By default, none of your content is available outside of Craft via GraphQL. In order to send GraphQL queries to Craft, we need to establish an endpoint for receiving them and an appropriate set of permissions with a token.

### Create Your API Endpoint

The first step to adding a GraphQL API to your project is to set up a public endpoint for it.

To do that, create a [URL rule](routing.md#advanced-routing-with-url-rules) from `config/routes.php` that points to the `graphql/api` controller action. For example, the following URL rule would cause `/api` requests to route to the GraphQL API:

```php
return [
    'api' => 'graphql/api',
    // ...
];
```

::: tip
Craft sets an `access-control-allow-origin: *` header by default on GraphQL responses; consider limiting that for security using the <config3:allowedGraphqlOrigins> ::: tip When you are initially exploring the API, make sure that [Dev Mode](config3:devMode) is enabled so the IDE can be informed about the entire schema available to it.
:::

Pretending your endpoint is `http://my-project.test/api`, you can verify that it’s configured correctly by sending a `{ping}` query to it:

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/graphql" -d '{ping}' http://my-project.test/api
```

Using a `GET` request, with the GraphQL query defined by a `query` parameter:

```json
{"data":{"ping":"pong"}}
```

::: tip
The actual API features will depend on what your schema allows.
:::

### Define Your Schemas

Once you’ve created a GraphQL API endpoint, you need to tell Craft which content should be available from it. You do that by defining a **Schema**.

Craft has two types of schemas:

1. The **Public Schema** defines which content should be available publicly.
2. You can also define multiple private schemas, which each have their own secret **Access Token**.

Any GraphQL API request without a token will use the Public Schema. Craft with otherwise use a valid token to determine the relevant schema.

You can manage your schemas from the control panel, at GraphQL → Schemas. In addition to defining the scope of each schema, you can also give them expiration dates, or disable them.

## Sending API Requests

### Using the GraphiQL IDE

The easiest way to start exploring your GraphQL API is with the built-in [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) IDE, which is available in the control panel from GraphQL → Explore.

::: tip
The included GraphiQL IDE preselects a special “Full Schema” option for optimal exploration. You can change the applied schema from its dropdown menu.

### Using Another IDE

Additional GraphQL IDEs are available as well:

* [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)
* [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground)
* [GraphQL Playground online](https://www.graphqlbin.com/v2/new)

::: tip
When you’re initially exploring the API, make sure <config3:devMode> ::: tip The actual API features will depend on what your schema allows.
:::

### Sending Requests Manually

The GraphQL API can be queried in three ways:

1. Using a `POST` request with an `application/graphql` content type, with the GraphQL query defined by the raw request body:
  ```bash
  curl \
    --data-urlencode "query={ping}" \
    http://craft32.test/api
  # or
  curl http://craft32.test/api?query=%7Bping%7D
  ```
2. Using a `POST` request with an `application/json` content type, with the GraphQL query defined by a `query` key:
  ```bash
  curl \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"query":"{ping}"}' \
    http://my-project.test/api
  ```
3. **A `POST` request with an `application/graphql` content type** and the GraphQL query defined by the raw request body:
  ```bash
  curl \
    -H "Content-Type: application/graphql" \
    -d '{ping}' \
    http://my-project.test/api
  ```

#### Specifying Variables

If you need to specify any [variables](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#variables) along with your query, then you must send request as a `POST` request with an `application/json` content type, and include a `variables` key in the JSON body alongside `query`.

```bash
curl \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "query": "query($id:[Int]) { entries(id: $id) { id, title } }",
        "variables": { "id": [1, 2, 3] }
      }' \
  http://my-project.test/api
```

#### Querying a Private Schema

The Public Schema will be used by default. To query against a different [schema](#define-your-schemas), pass its Access Token using an `Authorization` header.

```bash
curl \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/graphql" \
  -d '{entries{id}}' \
  http://my-project.test/api
```

::: warning
If you’re unable to query a private schema because of a “missing authorization header”, make sure Craft received it from the web server with a quick post to a test template:

```twig
{{ craft.app.getRequest().getHeaders().has('authorization') ?
    'auth token present ✓' : 
    'auth token missing!' }}
```

Apache strips `Authorization` headers by default, which can be fixed by enabling [CGIPassAuth](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/en/mod/core.html#cgipassauth) or adding the following to your `.htaccess` file:

```
RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization} ^(.*)
RewriteRule .* - [e=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%1]
```
:::

## Caching

All query results are cached, so that repeated queries can yield results faster. The GraphQL result cache does not have a sophisticated ruleset on invalidating the cache - if the site's content or structure changes, the entire cache is invalidated.

Craft’s GraphQL result caching is enabled by default and you can disable it with the <config3:enableGraphQlCaching> setting.

## Interface Implementation

A defined type exists for each specific interface implementation. For example, if a “News” section has “Article” and “Editorial” entry types, in addition to the `EntryInterface` interface type, two additional types would be defined the GraphQL schema, if the token used allows it: `news_article_Entry` and `news_editorial_Entry` types.

## Query Reference

The actual API features will depend on what your schema allows.

## Mutations

Mutations in GraphQL provide a way of modifying data. The actual mutations will vary depending on the schema. There are some common mutations per GraphQL object type as well as type-specific mutations.

Mutations take the data as arguments. In this example, we’re using the type-specific `save_news_article_Entry` to save a new entry. We’re providing a title and slug and formatting the `dateCreated` that’s populated automatically when the entry is saved:

::: code
```graphql GraphQL
mutation saveEntry($title: String, $slug: String) {
  save_news_article_Entry(title: $title, slug: $slug) {
    title
    slug
    dateCreated @formatDateTime (format: "Y-m-d")
  }
}

# query variables:
{
  "title": "Craft 3.5 Supports GraphQL Mutations",
  "slug": "craft-graphql-mutations"
}
```
```json JSON Response
{
  "data": {
    "save_news_article_Entry": {
      "title": "Craft 3.5 Supports GraphQL Mutations",
      "slug": "craft-graphql-mutations",
      "dateCreated": "2020-04-18"
    }
  }
}
```
:::

Mutations take the data as arguments and, while for most part they are pretty straightforward, there are a few cases worth mentioning up front.

### Matrix fields in mutations

To create or update a tag use the tag group-specific mutation, which will have the name in the form of `save_<tagGroupHandle>_Tag`.

It is recommended to read up on [how to save matrix field data in entry forms](matrix-fields.md#saving-matrix-fields-in-entry-forms) if you are unfamiliar with that, first.
:::

To create or update a category use the category group-specific mutation, which will have the name in the form of `save_<categoryGroupHandle>_Tag`.

| Field       | Description                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sortOrder` | A list of all the block IDs that you wish the Matrix field to persist after the mutation in the required order. This include any new blocks.                                            |
| `blocks`    | A list of all the actual blocks. You don't have to include any blocks that are not modified, however, they must be represented on the `sortOrder` field if you don't want them deleted. |

An actual block input type will contain fields for all the possible block types for this field, however, the first non-empty block will be considered in the order that the block types are defined on the field.

Let's say you have a Matrix field with a handle `documentationField`.

This is the input type for the `screenshot` block. It will contain all the fields defined for that block type.

```
ingredients
├── spirit
│   ├── spiritName (Plain Text)
│   └── ounces (Number)
├── mixer
│   ├── mixerName (Plain Text)
│   └── ounces (Number)
└── garnish
    └── garnishName (Plain Text)
```

The following is a list of all the input types generated for this Matrix field.

| Type name                                        | Type Description                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `documentationField_MatrixInput`                 | This is the input type for the Matrix field. As discussed above, it will contain two fields: `sortOrder` and `blocks`.   |
| `documentationField_MatrixBlockContainerInput`   | This is the input type that represents the block. In this case it will contain two fields: `screenshot` and `paragraph`. |
| `documentationField_screenshot_MatrixBlockInput` | Input type for the `spirit` block, containing `spiritName` and `ounces`.                                                 |
| `documentationField_paragraph_MatrixBlockInput`  | In a similar fashion, this is the input type for the `paragraph` block.                                                  |
| `ingredients_garnish_MatrixBlockInput`           | Input type for the `garnish` block, containing `garnishName`.                                                            |

Mutating users with Craft native GraphQL API is currently not possible.

```graphql
input docunentationField_MatrixInput {
  sortOrder: [QueryArgument]!
  blocks: [documentationField_MatrixBlockContainerInput]
}

input documentationField_MatrixBlockContainerInput {
  screenshot: documentationField_screenshot_MatrixBlockInput
  paragraph: documentationField_paragraph_MatrixBlockInput
}

input documentationField_screenshot_MatrixBlockInput {
  # List of content fields defined for this block type
}

input documentationField_paragraph_MatrixBlockInput {
  # List of content fields defined for this block type
}
  spiritName: String
  ounces: Number
}

input ingredients_mixer_MatrixBlockInput {
  # ... common Matrix Block fields ...
  mixerName: String
  ounces: Number
}

input ingredients_garnish_MatrixBlockInput {
  # ... common Matrix Block fields ...
  garnishName: String
}
```

A mutation saving a new entry with multiple Matrix blocks might look like this:

::: code
```graphql GraphQL
mutation saveEntry(
  $title: String,
  $slug: String,
  $authorId: ID,
  $ingredients: [ingredients_MatrixBlockContainerInput],
  $sortOrder: [QueryArgument]
) {
  save_cocktails_cocktails_Entry(
    title: $title,
    slug: $slug,
    authorId: $authorId,
    ingredients: { blocks: $ingredients, sortOrder: $sortOrder }
  ) {
    title
    slug
    authorId
    dateCreated @formatDateTime (format: "Y-m-d")
    ingredients {
      __typename
        ...on MatrixBlockInterface {
          id
        }
        ... on ingredients_spirit_BlockType {
          spiritName
          ounces
        }
        ... on ingredients_mixer_BlockType {
          mixerName
          ounces
        }
        ... on ingredients_garnish_BlockType {
          garnishName
        }
     }
  }
}

        {

          "garnishName": "Lime Wedge or Twist"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
:::

What field on those objects would contain data would determine the final block type.

If more than one of the block types are defined, only the block type that is listed first will be considered.

### Uploading files via mutations

There are currently two ways to do a file upload - you can pass in a URL to the file that will be downloaded to the server or you can pass along the file data encoded in Base64.

Either way, wherever you're able to upload a file, you will have to use the `FileInput` GraphQL input type. It has the following fields.

| Field      | Description                                                                                     |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `url`      | The URL of the file to use                                                                      |
| `fileData` | The contents of the file in Base64 format. If provided, takes precedence over the URL.          |
| `filename` | The filename to use for the file. If not present, Craft will figure out a filename on it's own. |

### Mutating entries

#### Saving an entry

To save an entry use the entry type-specific mutation which will have the name in the form of `save_<sectionHandle>_<entryTypeHandle>_Entry`.

<!-- BEGIN ENTRY MUTATION ARGS -->

| Argument     | Type       | Description                                                                             |

<!-- END ENTRY MUTATION ARGS -->

The `id`, `uid` and `authorId` arguments do no exist for single entries. This is because single entries have no authors and are identified already by the exact mutation. In a similar fashion, there are additional arguments available for structured entries. For more information, refer to [mutating structure data](#mutating-structure-data)

::: tip
After saving an entry, Craft runs queue jobs for updating revisions and search indexes. If you’re using Craft headlessly or infrequently accessing the control panel, consider disabling <config3:runQueueAutomatically> and [establishing an always-running daemon](https://nystudio107.com/blog/robust-queue-job-handling-in-craft-cms) to keep revisions and search indexes up to date.
