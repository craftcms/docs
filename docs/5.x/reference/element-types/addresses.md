# Addresses

Addresses are a type of [element](../../system/elements.md) you’ll most commonly encounter in conjunction with [Users](users.md). [Querying addresses](#querying-addresses) and working with their [field data](#fields-and-formatting) is nearly identical to the experience working with any other element type.

<!-- more -->

For sites supporting [public registration](../../system/user-management.md#public-registration) (like a storefront built on [Craft Commerce](/commerce/5.x/)) users can manage their own [address book](#managing-addresses).

::: tip
Plugins are also able to use addresses to store their own location data.
:::

## Setup

Address elements share a single field layout, which is managed in the control panel via <Journey path="Settings, Addresses" />.

<BrowserShot url="https://my-project.ddev.site/admin/settings/addresses" :link="false">
<img src="../../images/address-field-layout.png" alt="Screenshot of the address element field layout" />
</BrowserShot>

### Native and Custom Fields

The address field layout has additional native (but optional) fields for a handful of useful attributes. Addresses—just like other element types—support custom fields for anything else you might need to store.

For compatibility and localization, core address components (aside from the Country Code) can’t be separated from one another in the field layout.

### Config Options

You may set a default country for new addresses via the <config5:defaultCountryCode> setting.

### Copying Addresses <Since ver="5.7.0" feature="Copying addresses" />

Addresses can be copied and pasted between users and [addresses fields](../field-types/addresses.md).

<See path="../../system/elements.md" hash="copying-elements" label="Copying Elements" description="Learn how to copy addresses and other elements between contexts." />

## Address Repository

The [commerceguys/addressing](repo:commerceguys/addressing) library powers planet-friendly address handling and formatting, and its exhaustive repository of global address information is available to all Craft projects. If you need a list of countries, states, or provinces, for example, you can fetch them via Craft’s [Addresses](craft5:craft\services\Addresses) service, from Twig templates or PHP:

::: code
```twig
{% set countries = craft.app.getAddresses().getCountryRepository().getAll() %}
```
```php
$countries = Craft::$app->getAddresses()->getCountryRepository()->getAll();
```
:::

This returns an array of [Country](repo:commerceguys/addressing/blob/master/src/Country/Country.php) objects, indexed by their two-letter code. You might use this to populate a dropdown menu:

```twig
<select name="myCountry">
  {% for code, country in countries %}
    <option value="{{ code }}">{{ country.name }}</option>
  {% endfor %}
</select>

{# Output:
<select name="myCountry">
  <option value="AF">Afghanistan</option>
  <option value="AX">Åland Islands</option>
  ...
</select>
#}
```

Similarly, a repository of subdivisions are available, hierarchically—with up to three levels, depending on how a given country is organized: _Administrative Area_ → _Locality_ → _Dependent Locality_.

Expanding upon our previous example, we could output a nicely organized list of “administrative areas,” like this:

```twig
{% set subdivisionRepo = craft.app.getAddresses().getSubdivisionRepository() %}
{% set countriesWithSubdivisions = countries | filter(c => subdivisionRepo.getAll([c.countryCode]) | length) %}

<select name="administrativeArea">
  {% for country in countriesWithSubdivisions %}
    {% set administrativeAreas = subdivisionRepo.getAll([country.countryCode]) %}

    <optgroup label="{{ country.name }}">
      {% for a in administrativeAreas %}
        <option value="{{ a.code }}">{{ a.name }}</option>
      {% endfor %}
    </optgroup>
  {% endfor %}
</select>
```

Either repository’s `getList()` method is a shortcut that returns only key-value pairs, suitable for our examples—it also accepts an array of “parent” groups (beginning with country code) to narrow the subdivisions.

::: tip
These designations are deliberately generic, and won’t generally be recognized by users. Check out the [labels](#attribute-labels) section for information on how to output localized or context-aware names for each level (i.e. _Provinces_ in Canada or _States_ and _Counties_ in the United States).
:::

You may supplement the subdivision data provided by the [upstream repository](https://github.com/commerceguys/addressing) by listening to the <craft5:craft\services\Addresses::EVENT_DEFINE_ADDRESS_SUBDIVISIONS> event in a plugin or module. Similarly, deeper customization of the required [fields](#fields-and-formatting) (and those fields’ [labels](#attribute-labels)) may require modifying the defaults via the [EVENT_DEFINE_USED_SUBDIVISION_FIELDS](craft5:craft\services\Addresses::EVENT_DEFINE_USED_SUBDIVISION_FIELDS) or [EVENT_DEFINE_FIELD_LABEL](craft5:craft\services\Addresses::EVENT_DEFINE_FIELD_LABEL) events.

::: tip
Check out the [addressing docs](https://github.com/commerceguys/addressing#data-model) for more details and examples of what’s possible—including translation of place names, postal codes, timezones, and [formatting](#fields-and-formatting)!
:::

## Fields and Formatting

### Field Handles

Individual fields—native and custom—are accessed via their handles, like any other element:

```twig
<ul>
  <li>Name: {{ myAddress.title }}</li>
  <li>Postal Code: {{ myAddress.postalCode }}</li>
  <li>Custom Label Color: {{ myAddress.myCustomColorFieldHandle }}</li>
</ul>
```

### Attribute Labels

The addressing library’s abstracted _Administrative Area_ → _Locality_ → _Dependent Locality_ terminology probably isn’t what you are accustomed to calling those address components in your part of the world—and it’s even less likely you’d want to show those terms to site visitors.

You can use any address element’s `attributeLabel()` method to get human-friendly labels for a given locale. Assuming we’re working with a U.S. address…

```twig
{{ myAddress.attributeLabel('administrativeArea') }} {# State #}
{{ myAddress.attributeLabel('locality') }} {# City #}
{{ myAddress.attributeLabel('dependentLocality') }} {# Suburb #}
{{ myAddress.attributeLabel('postalCode') }} {# Zip Code #}
```

Labels use the address’s current `countryCode` value for localization.

### `|address` Formatter

You can use the [`|address`](../twig/filters.md#address) filter to output a formatted address with basic HTML:

```twig
{{ myAddress|address }}
{# Output:
  <p translate="no">
    <span class="address-line1">1234 Balboa Towers Circle</span><br>
    <span class="locality">Los Angeles</span>, <span class="administrative-area">CA</span> <span class="postal-code">92662</span><br>
    <span class="country">United States</span>
  </p>
#}
```

The default formatter includes the following options:

- **locale** – defaults to `'en'`
- **html** – defaults to `true`; disable with `false` to maintain line breaks but omit HTML tags
- **html_tag** – defaults to `p`
- **html_attributes** – is an array that defaults to `['translate' => 'no']`

```twig
{# Swap enclosing paragraph tag for a `div`: #}
{{ myAddress|address({ html_tag: 'div' }) }}
{# Output:
  <div translate="no">
    <span class="address-line1">1234 Balboa Towers Circle</span><br>
    <span class="locality">Los Angeles</span>, <span class="administrative-area">CA</span> <span class="postal-code">92662</span><br>
    <span class="country">United States</span>
  </div>
#}

{# Turn the entire address into a Google Maps link: #}
{{ myAddress|address({
  html_tag: 'a',
  html_attributes: {
    href: url('https://maps.google.com/maps/search/', {
      query_place_id: address.myCustomPlaceIdField,
    }),
  },
}) }}
{# Output:
  <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps/search/?query_place_id=...">
    <span class="address-line1">1234 Balboa Towers Circle</span><br>
    <span class="locality">Los Angeles</span>, <span class="administrative-area">CA</span> <span class="postal-code">92662</span><br>
    <span class="country">United States</span>
  </a>
#}

{# Omit all HTML tags: #}
{{ myAddress|address({ html: false }) }}
{# Output:
  1234 Balboa Towers Circle
  Los Angeles, CA 92662
  United States
#}

{# Force output in the Ukrainian (`uk`) locale: #}
{{ myAddress|address({ html: false, locale: 'uk' }) }}
{# Output:
  1234 Balboa Towers Circle
  Los Angeles, CA 92662
  Сполучені Штати
#}
```

#### Country Names

Only the two-letter “country code” is stored on addresses. To display the full country name, use the attached [`Country`](repo:commerceguys/addressing/blob/master/src/Country/Country.php) model: <Since ver="5.3.0" feature="Address.getCountry()" />

```twig
{% set country = address.country %}

{{ country.name }}
```

Via the `Country` object, you also have access to the following data:

- `countryCode` — Same ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code as was stored as `address.countryCode`.
- `name` — Name of the country, localized for the current site.
- `threeLetterCode` — ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 code for the country.
- `numericalCode` — ISO ISO 3166-1 numeric codes.
- `currencyCode` — ISO 4217 currency code (not the symbol).
- `timezones` — A list of PHP timezone identifiers for the country. This is not necessarily specific to the address!
- `locale` — The locale the country name is localized for. Defaults to the app’s current language, which might be a site’s language or a control panel user’s language preference. If you need to manually localize a country’s name, see below.

In earlier versions of Craft, you must directly retrieve its definition from the [address repository](#address-repository):

```twig
{% set country = craft.app.getAddresses().getCountryRepository().get(address.countryCode) %}

{{ country.name }}
```

To get the localized name of a country outside of a formatted address, you must re-fetch it from the address repository:

```twig{2}
{% set repo = craft.app.addresses.getCountryRepository() %}
{% set country = repo.get(entry.country, currentSite.locale) %}

{{ country.name }}
{# -> In a site set to use US English (en-US): "United States" #}
{# -> In a site set to use Swiss French (fr-CH): "États-Unis" #}
```

### Customizing the Formatter

You can also pass your own formatter to the `|address` filter. The addressing library includes [PostalLabelFormatter](https://github.com/commerceguys/addressing/blob/master/src/Formatter/PostalLabelFormatter.php) to make it easier to print shipping labels. Here, we can specify that formatter and set its additional `origin_country` option:

```twig
{# Use the postal label formatter #}
{% set addressService = craft.app.getAddresses() %}
{% set labelFormatter = create(
  'CommerceGuys\\Addressing\\Formatter\\PostalLabelFormatter',
  [
    addressService.getAddressFormatRepository(),
    addressService.getCountryRepository(),
    addressService.getSubdivisionRepository(),
  ]) %}
{{ addr|address({ origin_country: 'GB' }, labelFormatter) }}
{# Output:
  1234 Balboa Towers Circle
  LOS ANGELES, CA 92662
  UNITED STATES
#}
```

You can also write a custom formatter that implements [FormatterInterface](https://github.com/commerceguys/addressing/blob/master/src/Formatter/FormatterInterface.php). We could extend the default formatter, for example, to add a `hide_countries` option that avoids printing the names of specified countries:

```php
<?php

namespace mynamespace;

use CommerceGuys\Addressing\AddressInterface;
use CommerceGuys\Addressing\Formatter\DefaultFormatter;
use CommerceGuys\Addressing\Locale;
use craft\helpers\Html;

class OptionalCountryFormatter extends DefaultFormatter
{
    /**
     * @inheritdoc
     */
    protected $defaultOptions = [
        'locale' => 'en',
        'html' => true,
        'html_tag' => 'p',
        'html_attributes' => ['translate' => 'no'],
        'hide_countries' => [],
    ];

    /**
     * @inheritdoc
     */
    public function format(AddressInterface $address, array $options = []): string
    {
        $this->validateOptions($options);
        $options = array_replace($this->defaultOptions, $options);
        $countryCode = $address->getCountryCode();
        $addressFormat = $this->addressFormatRepository->get($countryCode);

        if (!in_array($countryCode, $options['hide_countries'])) {
            if (Locale::matchCandidates($addressFormat->getLocale(), $address->getLocale())) {
                $formatString = '%country' . "\n" . $addressFormat->getLocalFormat();
            } else {
                $formatString = $addressFormat->getFormat() . "\n" . '%country';
            }
        } else {
            // If this is in our `hide_countries` list, omit the country
            $formatString = $addressFormat->getFormat();
        }

        $view = $this->buildView($address, $addressFormat, $options);
        $view = $this->renderView($view);
        $replacements = [];

        foreach ($view as $key => $element) {
            $replacements['%' . $key] = $element;
        }

        $output = strtr($formatString, $replacements);
        $output = $this->cleanupOutput($output);

        if (!empty($options['html'])) {
            $output = nl2br($output, false);

            // Add the HTML wrapper element with Craft’s HTML helper:
            $output = Html::tag($options['html_tag'], $output, $options['html_attributes']);
        }

        return $output;
    }
}
```

We can instantiate and use that just like the postal label formatter:

```twig
{# Use our custom formatter #}
{% set addressService = craft.app.getAddresses() %}
{% set customFormatter = create(
  'mynamespace\\OptionalCountryFormatter',
  [
    addressService.getAddressFormatRepository(),
    addressService.getCountryRepository(),
    addressService.getSubdivisionRepository(),
  ]
) %}
{{ addr|address({ hide_countries: ['US'] }, customFormatter) }}
{# Output:
  1234 Balboa Towers Circle
  Los Angeles, CA 92662
#}
```

To replace the default formatter, add the following to your [application configuration](../config/app.md):

```php
return [
    // ...
    'components' => [
        // ...
        'addresses' => [
            'class' => \craft\services\Addresses::class,
            'formatter' => new \mynamespace\OptionalCountryFormatter(
                new \CommerceGuys\Addressing\AddressFormat\AddressFormatRepository(),
                new \CommerceGuys\Addressing\Country\CountryRepository(),
                new \CommerceGuys\Addressing\Subdivision\SubdivisionRepository()
            )
        ],
    ],
];
```

::: warning
The default formatter is used in the control panel as well as your templates, so make sure it includes all the information required for administrators to act on users’ information! Complete address data is always be available when viewing or editing it in a slideout.
:::

## Managing Addresses

Users can add, edit, and delete their own addresses from the front-end via the `users/save-address` and `users/delete-address` [controller actions](../../development/forms.md#users-save-address).

Craft doesn’t automatically give Addresses their own URLs, though—so it’s up to you to define a [routing scheme](../../system/routing.md#advanced-routing-with-url-rules) for them via `routes.php`. We’ll cover each of these three routes in the following sections:

```php
<?php
return [
  // Listing Addresses
  'account' => ['template' => '_account/dashboard'],

  // New Addresses
  'account/addresses/new' => ['template' => '_account/edit-address'],

  // Existing Addresses
  'account/addresses/<addressUid:{uid}>' => ['template' => '_account/edit-address'],
];
```

::: tip
The next few snippets may be a bit dense—numbered comments are peppered throughout, corresponding to items in the **Guide** section just below it.
:::

#### Scaffolding

The following templates assume you have a layout functionally equivalent to the [models and validation](../../development/forms.md#models-and-validation) example.

### Listing Addresses

Let’s display the current user’s address book on their account “dashboard.”

::: code
```twig _account/dashboard.twig
{% extends '_layouts/default' %}

{% requireLogin %}

{# 1. Load Addresses: #}
{% set addresses = currentUser.getAddresses() %}

{% block content %}
  <h1>Hello, {{ currentUser.fullName }}!</h1>

  {% if addresses | length %}
    <ul>
      {% for address in addresses %}
        <li>
          {{ address.title }}<br>
          {{ address|address }}<br>

          {# 2. Build an edit URL: #}
          <a href="{{ url("account/addresses/#{address.uid}") }}">Edit</a>

          {# 3. Use a form to delete Addresses: #}
          <form method="post">
            {{ csrfInput() }}
            {{ actionInput('users/delete-address') }}
            {{ hiddenInput('addressId', address.id) }}

            <button>Delete</button>
          </form>
        </li>
      {% endfor $}
    </ul>
  {% else %}
    <p>You haven’t added any addresses, yet!</p>
  {% endif %}

  {# 4. Link to "new" route: #}
  <p><a href="{{ url('account/addresses/new') }}">New Address</a></p>
{% endblock %}
```
:::

#### Guide

1. We’re using a <craft5:craft\elements\User> convenience method to load the current user’s saved addresses, but this is equivalent to our earlier [query example](#querying-addresses).
2. These URLs will need to match the pattern defined in `routes.php`. In our case, that means we need to interpolate the Address’s UID into the path.
3. [Deleting an Address](../../development/forms.md#post-users-delete-address) requires a <badge vertical="baseline" type="verb">POST</badge> request, which—for the sake of simplicity—we’re handling with a regular HTML form.
4. The [New Address](#new-addresses) route is static—there’s nothing to interpolate or parameterize.

### New Addresses

The code for new addresses will end up being reused for [existing addresses](#existing-addresses).

::: code
```twig _account/edit-address.twig
{% extends '_layouts/default' %}

{% requireLogin %}

{% block content %}
  <h1>New Address</h1>

  {# 1. Render the form #}
  {{ include('_account/address-form', {
    address: address ?? create('craft\\elements\\Address'),
  }) }}
{% endblock %}
```
```twig _account/address-form.twig
<form method="post">
  {{ csrfInput() }}

  {# 2. Set the controller action: #}
  {{ actionInput('users/save-address') }}

  {# 3. Special cases for existing addresses: #}
  {% if address.id %}
    {{ hiddenInput('addressId', address.id) }}
  {% endif %}

  {# 4. Redirection: #}
  {{ redirectInput('account/addresses/{uid}') }}

  {# 5. Address Fields: #}

  <label for="title">Title</label>
  <input
    type="text"
    name="title"
    id="title"
    value="{{ address.title }}">

  <label for="addressLine1">Address Line 1</label>
  <input
    type="text"
    name="addressLine1"
    id="addressLine1"
    value="{{ address.addressLine1 }}">

  <label for="addressLine2">Address Line 2</label>
  <input
    type="text"
    name="addressLine2"
    id="addressLine2"
    value="{{ address.addressLine2 }}">

  <label for="countryCode">Country</label>
  <select name="countryCode" id="countryCode">
    {% for country in craft.app.getAddresses().getCountryRepository().getAll() %}
      {{ tag('option', {
        value: country.countryCode,
        selected: country.countryCode == address.countryCode,
        text: country.name,
      }) }}
    {% endfor %}
  </select>

  {# ... #}

  <button>Save</button>
</form>
```
:::

#### Guide

1. We pass an <craft5:craft\elements\Address> to the form partial—either from an `address` variable that is available to the template after an attempted submission (say, due to validation errors), or a new one instantiated with the [`create()` function](../twig/functions.md#create).
2. Whether we’re creating a new address or editing an existing one (this partial handles both), the request should be sent to the `users/save-address` action.
3. Addresses that have been previously saved will have an `id`, so we need to send that back to apply updates to the correct Address.
4. The [`redirectInput()` function](../twig/functions.md#redirectinput) accepts an [object template](../../system/object-templates.md), which can include properties of the thing we’re working with. The template won’t be evaluated when it appears in the form—instead, Craft will render it using the address element _after_ it’s been successfully saved. In this case, we’ll be taken to the [edit screen](#existing-addresses) for the newly-saved address.
5. Which fields are output is up to you—but be aware that the selected `countryCode` may influence what additional address fields are required. If you want to capture input for [custom fields](../../system/fields.md), it should be nested under the `fields` key, as it is for entries and other element types: `<input type="text" name="fields[myCustomFieldHandle]" value="...">`

::: tip
See the [complete list of parameters](../../development/forms.md#post-users-save-address) that can be sent to the `users/save-address` action.
:::

### Existing Addresses

To edit an existing address, we’ll use the `addressUid` parameter from our route.

```twig
{% extends '_layouts/default' %}

{% requireLogin %}

{# 1. Resolve the address: #}
{% set address = address ?? craft.addresses
  .owner(currentUser)
  .uid(addressUid)
  .one() %}

{# 2. Make sure we got something: #}
{% if not address %}
  {% exit 404 %}
{% endif %}

{% block content %}
  <h1>Edit Address: {{ address.title }}</h1>

  {# 3. Render form: #}
  {{ include('_account/address-form', {
    address: address,
  }) }}
{% endblock %}
```

#### Guide

1. In one statement, we’re checking for the presence of an `address` variable sent back to the template by a prior submission, and falling back to a lookup against the user’s Addresses. By calling `.owner(currentUser)`, we can be certain we’re only ever showing a user an Address they own.
2. If an Address wasn’t passed back to the template, _and_ the UID from our route didn’t match one of the current user’s addresses, we bail.
3. The Address is passed to the form partial for rendering—see the [new address example](#new-addresses) for the form’s markup.


## Validating Addresses

Addresses are validated like any other type of element, but some of the rules are dependent upon its localized format.

You can set requirements for custom fields in the Address Fields [field layout](#native-custom-fields), but additional validation of any address properties requires a [custom plugin or module](../../extend/README.md).

::: tip
Take a look at the [Using Events in a Custom Module](kb:custom-module-events) article for a dedicated primer on module setup and events.
:::

[Validation rules](guide:input-validation) are added via the `Model::EVENT_DEFINE_RULES` event:

```php
use yii\base\Event;
use craft\base\Model;
use craft\elements\Address;
use craft\events\DefineRulesEvent;

Event::on(
    Address::class,
    Model::EVENT_DEFINE_RULES,
    function(DefineRulesEvent $event) {
        $event->rules[] = [
            ['fullName'],
            'match',
            'pattern' => '/droid|bot/i',
            'message' => Craft::t('site', 'Robots are not allowed.'),
        ];
    }
);
```

Errors are available through the same `address.getErrors()` method used in other action and [model validation examples](../../development/forms.md#models-and-validation), regardless of whether they were produced by built-in rules or ones you added.

## Querying Addresses

You can fetch addresses in your templates or PHP code using an [AddressQuery](craft5:craft\elements\db\AddressQuery).

::: code
```twig
{# Create a new address query #}
{% set myAddressQuery = craft.addresses() %}
```
```php
// Create a new address query
$myAddressQuery = \craft\elements\Address::find();
```
:::

<See path="../../development/element-queries.md" label="Introduction to Element Queries" description="Learn more about how element queries work." />

### Example

Let’s output a list of the logged-in user’s addresses:

1. Create an address query with `craft.addresses()`.
2. Restrict the query to addresses owned by the current User, with the [`owner`](#owner) parameter.
3. Fetch the addresses with `.all()`.
4. Loop through the addresses using a [`{% for %}` tag](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/tags/for.html).
5. Output preformatted address details with the [`|address`](../twig/filters.md#address) filter.

```twig
{% requireLogin %}

{% set addresses = craft.addresses()
  .owner(currentUser)
  .all() %}

{% for addr in addresses %}
  <address>{{ addr|address }}</address>
{% endfor %}
```

We’ll expand on this example in the [Managing Addresses](#managing-addresses) section.

::: warning
Protect your users’ personal information by carefully auditing queries and displaying private addresses only on pages that [require login](../twig/tags.md#requirelogin).
:::

### Parameters

Address queries support the following parameters:
