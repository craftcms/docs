# Categories Fields

<div class="version-warning">

Categories are being phased out in favor of [Structure sections](../element-types/entries.md#structures). The corresponding [entries field](entries.md) has a _maintain hierarchy_ setting that mimics categories fields.

Read more about this [transition](https://craftcms.com/blog/entrification) on our blog.

</div>

Categories fields allow you to relate [categories](../element-types/categories.md) to other elements. It is one of Craft’s [relational](../../system/relations.md) custom fields.

<!-- more -->

## Settings

Categories fields have the following settings:

- **Source** — Which category group (or other category index [source](../../system/elements.md#sources)) the field should be able to relate categories from.
- **Maintain Hierarchy** — Should the selected categories’ order and hierarchy be preserved?

  When **enabled**, the following options become available:

  - **Branch Limit** — How many distinct “branches” of the category tree can be selected?

  When **disabled**, these options are available:

  - **Min Relations** — The minimum number of categories that must be selected when the field is marked as “required” in a field layout. (Default is no minimum.)
  - **Max Relations** — The maximum number of categories that can be selected. (Default is no maximum.)

- **View Mode** — How the related users are displayed to authors (_List_ or _Cards_).
- **“Add” Button Label** — The label that should be used on the field’s selection button.
- **Validate related categories** — Whether or not validation errors on the related categories will be bubbled up.

### Advanced Settings

Additional settings are available under the **Advanced** toggle:

- **Allow self-relations** — If this field is added to a category group field layout, should the author be allowed to select the category they are editing as a relationship to itself?

### Multi-Site Settings

On multi-site installs, the following settings will also be available:

- **Translation Method** — How relationships are handled when [propagating changes to other sites](../../system/fields.md#translation-methods).
- **Relate categories from a specific site?** — Whether to only allow relations to categories from a specific site.
  - If _enabled_, a new setting will appear where you can choose which site.
  - If _disabled_, related categories will always be pulled from the current site.

- **Show the site menu** — Whether to display the site menu in category selection modals. (This setting is hidden when relations are locked to a single site.)

<See path="../../system/fields.md" hash="translation-methods" label="Translation Methods" description="Learn about options for translating field values." />

## The Field

Categories fields list all the currently-related categories with a button to select new ones.

Choosing **Add a category** will bring up a modal window where you can find and select additional categories. You can create new categories from this modal as well, by choosing **New category**.

When you select a nested category, all the ancestors leading up to that category will also automatically be related. Likewise, when you remove a category from within the main field input, any of its descendants will also be removed.

### Inline Category Editing

Double-click on a related category to edit it in a [slideout](../../system/control-panel.md#slideouts).

## Development

### Querying Elements with Categories Fields

When [querying for elements](../../development/element-queries.md) that have a Categories field, you can filter the results based on the Categories field data using a query param named after your field’s handle.

Possible values include:

| Value | Fetches elements…
| - | -
| `':empty:'` | that don’t have any related categories.
| `':notempty:'` | that have at least one related category.
| `100` | that are related to the category with an ID of 100.
| `[100, 200]` | that are related to a category with an ID of 100 or 200.
| `[':empty:', 100, 200]` | with no related categories, or are related to a category with an ID of 100 or 200.
| `['and', 100, 200]` | that are related to the categories with IDs of 100 and 200.
| a [Category](craft5:craft\elements\Category) object | that are related to the category.
| a [CategoryQuery](craft5:craft\elements\db\CategoryQuery) object | that are related to any of the resulting categories.

::: code
```twig
{# Fetch entries with a related category #}
{% set entries = craft.entries()
  .myFieldHandle(':notempty:')
  .all() %}
```
```php
// Fetch entries with a related category
$entries = \craft\elements\Entry::find()
    ->myFieldHandle(':notempty:')
    ->all();
```
:::

### Working with Categories Field Data

If you have an element with a Categories field in your template, you can access its related categories using your Categories field’s handle:

::: code
```twig
{% set query = entry.myFieldHandle %}
```
```php
$query = $entry->myFieldHandle; 
```
:::

That will give you a [category query](../element-types/categories.md#querying-categories), prepped to output all the related categories for the given field.

To loop through all the related categories as a flat list, call [all()](craft5:craft\db\Query::all()) and then loop over the results:

::: code
```twig
{% set relatedCategories = entry.myFieldHandle.all() %}
{% if relatedCategories|length %}
  <ul>
    {% for rel in relatedCategories %}
      <li><a href="{{ rel.url }}">{{ rel.title }}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
{% endif %}
```
```php
$relatedCategories = $entry->myFieldHandle->all();
if (count($relatedCategories)) {
    foreach ($relatedCategories as $rel) {
        // do something with $rel->url and $rel->title
    }
}
```
:::

Or you can show them as a hierarchical list with the [nav](../twig/tags.md#nav) tag:

```twig
{% set relatedCategories = entry.myFieldHandle.all() %}
{% if relatedCategories|length %}
  <ul>
    {% nav rel in relatedCategories %}
      <li>
        <a href="{{ rel.url }}">{{ rel.title }}</a>
        {% ifchildren %}
          <ul>
            {% children %}
          </ul>
        {% endifchildren %}
      </li>
    {% endnav %}
  </ul>
{% endif %}
```

If you only want the first related category, call [one()](craft5:craft\db\Query::one()) instead and make sure it returned something:

::: code
```twig
{% set rel = entry.myFieldHandle.one() %}
{% if rel %}
  <p><a href="{{ rel.url }}">{{ rel.title }}</a></p>
{% endif %}
```
```php
$rel = $entry->myFieldHandle->one();
if ($rel) {
    // do something with $rel->url and $rel->title
}
```
:::

If you need to check for related categories without fetching them, you can call [exists()](craft5:craft\db\Query::exists()):

::: code
```twig
{% if entry.myFieldHandle.exists() %}
  <p>There are related categories!</p>
{% endif %}
```
```php
if ($entry->myFieldHandle->exists()) {
    // do something with related categories
}
```
:::

You can set [parameters](../element-types/categories.md#parameters) on the category query as well. For example, to only fetch the “leaves” (categories without any children), set the [leaves](../element-types/categories.md#leaves) param:

::: code
```twig
{% set relatedCategories = entry.myFieldHandle
  .leaves()
  .all() %}
```
```php
$relatedAssets = $entry->myFieldHandle
    ->leaves()
    ->all();
```
:::

::: tip
<Todo notes="Extract this into a snippet." />

In Craft 3, we recommended cloning these query objects using the [`clone` keyword](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.cloning.php) or [`clone()`](../twig/functions.md#clone) Twig function before applying params. **This is no longer required in Craft 4**, because a new copy of the query is returned each time you access the field property.
:::

### Saving Categories Fields

If you have an element form, such as an [entry form](kb:entry-form), that needs to contain a Categories field, you will need to submit your field value as a list of category IDs.

For example, you could create a list of checkboxes for each of the possible relations:

```twig
{# Include a hidden input first so Craft knows to update the existing value
   if no checkboxes are checked. #}
{{ hiddenInput('fields[myFieldHandle]', '') }}

{# Get all of the possible category options #}
{% set possibleCategories = craft.categories()
  .group('food')
  .all() %}

{# Get the currently related category IDs #}
{% set relatedCategoryIds = entry is defined
  ? entry.myFieldHandle.ids()
  : [] %}

<ul>
  {% nav possibleCategory in possibleCategories %}
    <li>
      <label>
        {{ input(
          'checkbox',
          'fields[myFieldHandle][]',
          possibleCategory.id,
          { checked: possibleCategory.id in relatedCategoryIds }
        ) }}
        {{ possibleCategory.title }}
      </label>
      {% ifchildren %}
        <ul>
          {% children %}
        </ul>
      {% endifchildren %}
    </li>
  {% endnav %}
</ul>
```

::: tip
Note that it’s not possible to customize the order that categories will be related in, and if a nested category is related, so will each of its ancestors.
