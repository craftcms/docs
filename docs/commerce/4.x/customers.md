# Customers

Commerce leverages Craft’s native [User](/4.x/users.md) element to represent and track customers.

As soon as an email address is added to an [Order](./orders-carts.md), a customer is created or attached—but because some customers remain guests through checkout, the underlying user may never become [credentialed](#customers-and-users).

## Customer Info Tab

Go to **Users** in Craft’s global navigation to see a complete list of the site’s users. Clicking any user’s name will take you to their edit screen, where you’ll find a **Commerce** tab:

This tab includes the following:

- **Orders** – a searchable list of the customer’s orders.
- **Active Carts** – a list of the customer’s _active_ carts, based on the [activeCartDuration](config-settings.md#activecartduration) setting.
- **Inactive Carts** – a list of the customer’s _inactive_ carts, based on the [activeCartDuration](config-settings.md#activecartduration) setting.
- **Subscriptions** – a list of the customer’s subscriptions.

The visibility of this tab is controlled by the [showCustomerInfoTab](config-settings.md#showeditusercommercetab) setting.

::: tip
If you’d like to be able to see and manage customer addresses from the control panel, [include the addresses field](/4.x/addresses.md#setup) in the user field layout.

## Customers and Users

A customer with saved login information is considered a [credentialed](/4.x/users.md#active-and-inactive-users) user. Conversely, customers who check out as guests are set up as inactive users.

### User Checkout

::: warning
Prior to version 4.5, some customer registration features were only only available in Commerce Pro.
:::

Logged in customers are bound to their cart the moment it is created.

A guest can register for an account before or after checkout using a standard [Craft user registration form](kb:front-end-user-accounts#registration-form). This workflow may look a bit different depending on your configuration:

Setting | Result
------- | ------
<config4:useEmailAsUsername> | Only requires an email address to register; can be pre-filled if the customer already set an email on their cart (as this creates an inactive user, behind the scenes).
<config4:deferPublicRegistrationPassword> | A password is set only after activating their account (typically only used in combination with [email verification](/4.x/user-management.md#public-registration)).

### Guest Checkout

If someone visits the store and checks out as a guest, a new inactive user is created and related to the order—and any future orders using the same email address will be consolidated under that user.

#### Registration at Checkout

You can also offer the option to initiate registration _at_ checkout by sending the `registerUserOnOrderComplete` param when [updating a cart](./dev/controller-actions.md#post-cart-update-cart) or [submitting payment](./dev/controller-actions.md#post-payments-pay).

If a customer chooses to register an account upon order completion, an activation link is sent to the email on file.

```twig
{% set cart = craft.commerce.carts.cart %}

<form method="post">
  {{ csrfInput() }}
  {{ actionInput('commerce/cart/update-cart') }}

  {{ input('checbox', 'registerUserOnOrderComplete', 1, {checked: cart.registerUserOnOrderComplete}) }}

  {# ... #}

  <button>Save cart</button>
</form>
```

When registering at checkout, the order’s billing and shipping [addresses](addresses.md) are automatically saved to the new accounts for future use. <Since product="Commerce" repo="craftcms/commerce" ver="4.3.0" feature="Auto-saving guest address when registering at checkout" />
