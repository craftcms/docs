# Configuring Craft

There are several ways to configure Craft depending on your needs.

## General Config Settings

Craft supports several [general config settings](config-settings.md). You can override their default values in your `config/general.php` file.

```php
return [
    'devMode' => true,
];
```

## Database Connection Settings

Craft supports several [database connection settings](db-settings.md). You can override their default values in your `config/db.php` file.

## Guzzle Config

Craft uses [Guzzle 6](http://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/latest/) whenever creating HTTP requests, such as:

- when checking for Craft updates
- when sending in a support request from the Craft Support widget
- when loading RSS feeds from the Feeds widget
- when working with assets on remote volumes, like Amazon S3

You can customize the config settings Guzzle uses when sending these requests by creating a `guzzle.php` file in your `config/` folder. The file should return an array, with your config overrides.

```php
<?php

return [
    'headers' => ['Foo' => 'Bar'],
    'query'   => ['testing' => '123'],
    'auth'    => ['username', 'password'],
    'proxy'   => 'tcp://localhost:80',
];
```

The options defined here will be passed into new `GuzzleHttp\Client` instances. See [Guzzle’s documentation](http://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/latest/) for a list of available options.

## Aliases

Some settings and functions in Craft support [Yii aliases](https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/2.0/en/concept-aliases), which are basically placeholders for base file system paths and URLs. These include:

- Sites’ Base URL settings
- Volumes’ Base URL settings
- Local volumes’ File System Path settings
- The <config3:resourceBasePath> and <config3:resourceBaseUrl> config settings
- The [svg()](../dev/functions.md#svg-svg-sanitize) Twig function

The following aliases are available out of the box:

| Alias                | Description                                                                               |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@app`               | The path to `vendor/craftcms/cms/src/`                                                    |
| `@config`            | The path to your `config/` folder                                                         |
| `@contentMigrations` | The path to your `migrations/` folder                                                     |
| `@craft`             | The path to `vendor/craftcms/cms/src/`                                                    |
| `@lib`               | The path to `vendor/craftcms/cms/lib/`                                                    |
| `@root`              | The root project path (same as the [CRAFT_BASE_PATH](#craft-base-path) PHP constant)    |
| `@runtime`           | The path to your `storage/runtime/` folder                                                |
| `@storage`           | The path to your `storage/` folder                                                        |
| `@templates`         | The path to your `templates/` folder                                                      |
| `@translations`      | The path to your `translations/` folder                                                   |
| `@vendor`            | The path to your `vendor/` folder                                                         |
| `@web`               | The URL to the folder that contains the `index.php` file that was loaded for the request  |
| `@webroot`           | The path to the folder that contains the `index.php` file that was loaded for the request |

You can override these default aliases with the <config3:aliases> config setting if needed. It’s recommended to override the `@web` alias if you plan on using it, to avoid a cache poisoning vulnerability.

```php
'aliases' => [
    '@web' => 'http://my-project.com',
];
```

If your web root is something besides `web/`, `public/`, `public_html/`, or `html/`, or it’s not located alongside your `craft` executable, you will also need to override the `@webroot` alias, so it can be defined properly for console commands.

```php
'aliases' => [
    '@web' => 'http://my-project.com',
    '@webroot' => dirname(__DIR__) . '/path/to/webroot',
];
```

You can define additional custom aliases using the <config3:aliases> config setting as well. For example, you may wish to create aliases that define the base URL and base path that your asset volumes will live in.

```php
'aliases' => [
    '@web' => 'http://my-project.com',
    '@webroot' => dirname(__DIR__) . '/path/to/webroot',
    '@assetBaseUrl' => '@web/assets',
    '@assetBasePath' => '@webroot/assets',
],
```

With those in place, you could begin your asset volumes’ Base URL and File System Path settings with them, e.g. `@assetBaseUrl/user-photos` and `@assetBasePath/user-photos`.

If you’d like, you can set the alias values with environment variables, either from your `.env` file or somewhere in your environment’s configuration:

```bash
ASSETS_BASE_URL=http://my-project.com/assets
ASSETS_BASE_PATH=/path/to/webroot/assets
```

Then you can pull them into the alias definitions using [getenv()](http://php.net/manual/en/function.getenv.php):

```php
'aliases' => [
    '@assetBaseUrl' => getenv('ASSETS_BASE_URL'),
    '@assetBasePath' => getenv('ASSETS_BASE_PATH'),
],
```

::: tip
When referencing aliases in your settings, you can append additional segments onto the URL or path. For example, you can set a volume’s base URL to `@assetBaseUrl/user-photos`.
:::

::: tip
You can parse aliases in your templates by passing them to the [alias()](../dev/functions.html#alias-string) function:

```twig
{{ alias('@assetBaseUrl') }}
```
:::

## URL Rules

You can define custom [URL rules](https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/2.0/en/runtime-routing#url-rules) in `config/routes.php`. See [Routing](../routing.md) for more details.

## Application Configuration

You can customize Craft’s entire [Yii application configuration](https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/2.0/en/structure-applications#application-configurations) from `config/app.php`. Any items returned by that array will get merged into the main application configuration array.

You can also customize Craft’s application configuration for only web requests or console requests from `config/app.web.php` and `config/app.console.php`.

::: tip
Craft’s default configuration is defined by [src/config/app.php](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/blob/main/src/config/app.php), [app.web.php](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/blob/main/src/config/app.web.php), and [app.console.php](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/blob/main/src/config/app.console.php). Refer to these files when you need to override existing application components.
:::

### Cache Component

By default, Craft will store data caches in the `storage/runtime/cache/` folder. You can configure Craft to use alternative [cache storage](https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/2.0/en/caching-data#supported-cache-storage) by overriding the `cache` application component from `config/app.php`.

::: tip
Make sure that your `config/app.php` file is setting a unique `id` for your application, like [new Craft projects are doing](https://github.com/craftcms/craft/blob/master/config/app.php#L23). If not, add that missing line, and run the following command to add a unique `APP_ID` environment variable to your `.env` file:

    php craft setup/app-id
:::

#### Database Cache Example

If you want to store data caches in the database, first you will need to create a `cache` table as specified by <yii2:yii\caching\DbCache::$cacheTable>. Craft provides a console command for convenience:

```bash
php craft setup/db-cache-table
```

Once that’s done, you can set your `cache` application component to use <craft3:craft\cache\DbCache>.

```php
<?php
return [
    'components' => [
        'cache' => craft\cache\DbCache::class,
    ],
];
```

::: tip
If you’ve already configured Craft to use <yii2:yii\caching\DbCache> rather than <craft3:craft\cache\DbCache>, you can safely switch to the latter if you remove your `cache` table’s `dateCreated`, `dateUpdated`, and `uid` columns.
:::

#### APC Example

```php
<?php
return [
    'components' => [
        'cache' => [
            'class' => yii\caching\MemCache::class,
            'useMemcached' => true,
            'username' => getenv('MEMCACHED_USERNAME'),
            'password' => getenv('MEMCACHED_PASSWORD'),
            'defaultDuration' => 86400,
            'servers' => [
                [
                    'host' => 'localhost',
                    'persistent' => true,
                    'port' => 11211,
                    'retryInterval' => 15,
                    'status' => true,
                    'timeout' => 15,
                    'weight' => 1,
                ],
            ],
            'keyPrefix' => 'a_unique_key',
        ],
    ],
];
```


#### Memcached Example

```php
<?php
return [
    'components' => [
        'redis' => [
            'class' => yii\redis\Connection::class,
            'hostname' => 'localhost',
            'port' => 6379,
            'password' => getenv('REDIS_PASSWORD'),
        ],
        'cache' => [
            'class' => yii\redis\Cache::class,
            'defaultDuration' => 86400,
            'keyPrefix' => 'a_unique_key',
        ],
    ],
];
```

#### Redis Example

To use Redis cache storage, you will first need to install the [yii2-redis](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-redis) library. Then configure Craft’s `cache` component to use it:

```php
<?php
return [
    'components' => [
        'db' => function() {
            // Get the default component config
            $config = craft\helpers\App::dbConfig();

            // Use read/write query splitting
            // (requires Craft 3.4.25 or later)

            // Define the default config for replica DB connections
            $config['replicaConfig'] = [
                'username' => getenv('DB_REPLICA_USER'),
                'password' => getenv('DB_REPLICA_PASSWORD'),
                'tablePrefix' => getenv('DB_TABLE_PREFIX'),
                'attributes' => [
                    // Use a smaller connection timeout
                    PDO::ATTR_TIMEOUT => 10,
                ],
                'charset' => 'utf8',
            ];

            // Define the replica DB connections
            $config['replicas'] = [
                ['dsn' => getenv('DB_REPLICA_DSN_1')],
                ['dsn' => getenv('DB_REPLICA_DSN_2')],
                ['dsn' => getenv('DB_REPLICA_DSN_3')],
                ['dsn' => getenv('DB_REPLICA_DSN_4')],
            ];

            // Instantiate and return it
            return Craft::createObject($config);
        },
    ],
];
```

### Database Component

If you need to configure the database connection beyond what’s possible with Craft’s [database config settings](db-settings.md), you can do that by overriding the `db` component:

```php
<?php
return [
    'components' => [
        'redis' => [
            'class' => yii\redis\Connection::class,
            'hostname' => 'localhost',
            'port' => 6379,
            'password' => getenv('REDIS_PASSWORD'),
        ],
        'session' => function() {
            // Get the default component config
            $config = craft\helpers\App::sessionConfig();

            // Override the class to use Redis' session class
            $config['class'] = yii\redis\Session::class;

            // Instantiate and return it
            return Craft::createObject($config);
        },
    ],
];
```

### Session Component

In a load-balanced environment, you may want to override the default `session` component to store PHP session data in a centralized location.

#### Redis Example

```php
<?php
return [
    'components' => [
        'cache' => [
            'class' => yii\caching\ApcCache::class,
            'useApcu' => true,
            'keyPrefix' => 'a_unique_key',
        ],
    ],
];
```

#### Database Example

First, you must create the database table that will store PHP’s sessions. You can do that by running the `craft setup/php-session-table` console command from your project’s root folder.

```php
<?php
return [
    'components' => [
        'session' => function() {
            // Get the default component config
            $config = craft\helpers\App::sessionConfig();

            // Override the class to use DB session class
            $config['class'] = yii\web\DbSession::class;

            // Set the session table name
            $config['sessionTable'] = craft\db\Table::PHPSESSIONS;

            // Instantiate and return it
            return Craft::createObject($config);
        },
    ],
];
```

::: tip
The `session` component **must** be configured with the <craft3:craft\behaviors\SessionBehavior> behavior, which adds methods to the component that the system relies on.
:::

### Mailer Component

To override the `mailer` component config (which is responsible for sending emails), do this in `config/app.php`:

```php
<?php
return [
    'components' => [
        'mailer' => function() {
            // Get the stored email settings
            $settings = craft\helpers\App::mailSettings();

            // Override the transport adapter class
            $settings->transportType = craft\mailgun\MailgunAdapter::class;

            // Override the transport adapter settings
            $settings->transportSettings = [
                'domain' => 'foo.com',
                'apiKey' => 'key-xxxxxxxxxx',
            ];

            // Create a Mailer component config with these settings
            $config = craft\helpers\App::mailerConfig($settings);

            // Instantiate and return it
            return Craft::createObject($config);
        },
    ],
];
```

::: tip
Any changes you make to the Mailer component from `config/app.php` will not be reflected when testing email settings from Settings → Email.
:::

### Queue Component

Craft’s job queue is powered by the [Yii2 Queue Extension](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-queue). By default Craft will use a [custom queue driver](craft3:craft\queue\Queue) based on the extension’s [DB driver](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-queue/blob/master/docs/guide/driver-db.md), but you can switch to a different driver by overriding Craft’s `queue` component from `config/app.php`:

```php
<?php
return [
    'components' => [
        'queue' => [
            'class' => yii\queue\redis\Queue::class,
            'redis' => 'redis', // Redis connection component or its config
            'channel' => 'queue', // Queue channel key
        ],
    ],
];
```

Available drivers are listed in the [Yii2 Queue Extension documentation](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-queue/tree/master/docs/guide).

::: warning
Only drivers that implement <craft3:craft\queue\QueueInterface> will be visible within the control panel.
:::

::: tip
If your queue driver supplies its own worker, set the <config3:runQueueAutomatically> config setting to `false` in `config/general.php`.
:::

### Modules

You can register and bootstrap custom Yii modules into the application from `config/app.php` as well. See [How to Build a Module](../extend/module-guide.md) for more info.

## Environmental Configuration

Some settings should be defined on a per-environment basis. For example, when developing locally, you may want your site’s base URL to be `http://my-project.test`, but on production it should be `https://my-project.com`.

### Control Panel Settings

Some settings in the control panel can be set to environment variables (like the ones defined in your `.env` file):

- General Settings
  - **System Name**
- Sites
  - **Base URL**
- Sections
  - **Preview Target URIs**
- Asset Volumes
  - **Base URL**
  - **File System Path** (Local)
- Email
  - **System Email Address**
  - **Sender Name**
  - **HTML Email Template**
  - **Username** (Gmail and SMTP)
  - **Password** (Gmail and SMTP)
  - **Host Name** (SMTP)
  - **Port** (Port)

To set these settings to an environment variable, type `$` followed by the environment variable’s name.

![A volume’s Base URL setting](../images/volume-base-url-setting.jpg)

Only the environment variable’s name will be stored in your database or project config, so this is a great way to set setting values that may change per-environment, or contain sensitive information.

::: tip
Plugins can add support for environment variables and aliases in their settings as well. See [Environmental Settings](../extend/environmental-settings.md) to learn how.
:::

#### Using Aliases in Control Panel Settings

Some of these settings—the ones that store a URL or a file system path—can also be set to [aliases](README.md#aliases), which is helpful if you just want to store a base URL or path in an environment variable, and append additional segments onto it.

For example, you can define a `ROOT_URL` environment variable that is set to the root URL of your site:

```bash
# -- .env --
ROOT_URL="http://my-project.test"
```
Then create a `@rootUrl` alias that references it:

```php
// -- config/general.php --
'aliases' => [
    '@rootUrl' => getenv('ROOT_URL'),
],
```

Then you could go into your User Photos volume’s settings (for example) and set its Base URL to `@rootUrl/images/user-photos`.

### Config Files

You can set your [general config settings](config-settings.md), [database connection settings](db-settings.md), and other PHP config files to environment variables using PHP’s [getenv()](http://php.net/manual/en/function.getenv.php) function:

```bash
# -- .env --
CP_TRIGGER="secret-word"
```

```php
// -- config/general.php --
'cpTrigger' => getenv('CP_TRIGGER') ?: 'admin',
```

#### Multi-Environment Configs

Craft’s PHP config files can optionally define separate config settings for each individual environment.

```php
// -- config/general.php --
return [
    // Global settings
    '*' => [
        'omitScriptNameInUrls' => true,
    ],

    // Dev environment settings
    'dev' => [
        'devMode' => true,
    ],

    // Production environment settings
    'production' => [
        'cpTrigger' => 'secret-word',
    ],
];
```

The `'*'` key is required here so Craft knows to treat it as a multi-environment key, but the other keys are up to you. Craft will look for the key(s) that match the [CRAFT_ENVIRONMENT](#craft-environment) PHP constant, which should be defined by your `web/index.php` file. (Your server’s hostname will be used as a fallback.)

By default, new Craft 3 projects will define the [CRAFT_ENVIRONMENT](#craft-environment) constant using an environment variable called `ENVIRONMENT`, which is defined in the `.env` file:

```bash
# -- .env --
ENVIRONMENT="dev"
```

```php
// -- web/index.php --
define('CRAFT_ENVIRONMENT', getenv('ENVIRONMENT') ?: 'production');
```

## PHP Constants

Your `web/index.php` file can define certain PHP constants, which Craft’s bootstrap script will check for while loading and configuring Craft.

### `CRAFT_BASE_PATH`

The path to the **base directory** that Craft will look for [config/](../directory-structure.md#config), [templates/](../directory-structure.md#templates), and other directories within by default. (It is assumed to be the parent of the `vendor/` folder by default.)

```php
// Tell Craft to look for config/, templates/, etc., two levels up from here
define('CRAFT_BASE_PATH', dirname(__DIR__, 2));
```

### `CRAFT_COMPOSER_PATH`

The path to the [composer.json](../directory-structure.md#composer-json) file. (It is assumed to live within the base directory by default.)

```php
define('CRAFT_COMPOSER_PATH', 'path/to/composer.json');
```

### `CRAFT_CONFIG_PATH`

The path to the [config/](../directory-structure.md#config) folder. (It is assumed to live within the base directory by default.)

### `CRAFT_CONTENT_MIGRATIONS_PATH`

The path to the [migrations/](../directory-structure.md#migrations) folder used to store content migrations. (It is assumed to live within the base directory by default.)

### `CRAFT_CP`

Dictates whether the current request should be treated as a control panel request.

```php
// Tell Craft that this is a control panel request
define('CRAFT_CP', true);
```

If this isn’t defined, Craft will treat the request as a control panel request if either of these are true:

- The <config3:baseCpUrl> setting **is** set, and the request URL begins with it (plus the <config3:cpTrigger> setting, if set).
- The <config3:baseCpUrl> setting **is not** set, and the request URI begins with the <config3:cpTrigger> setting.

### `CRAFT_ENVIRONMENT`

The environment name that [multi-environment configs](../config/README.md#multi-environment-configs) can reference when defining their environment-specific config arrays. (`$_SERVER['SERVER_NAME']` will be used by default.)

```php
// Set the environment from the ENVIRONMENT env var, or default to 'production'
define('CRAFT_ENVIRONMENT', getenv('ENVIRONMENT') ?: 'production');
```

### `CRAFT_EPHEMERAL`

When defined as `true`, Craft will skip file system permission checks and operations that are not available in an environment with ephemeral or read-only storage.

### `CRAFT_LICENSE_KEY`

Your Craft license key, if for some reason that must be defined by PHP rather than a license key file. (Don’t set this until you have a valid license key.)

### `CRAFT_LICENSE_KEY_PATH`

The path that Craft should store its license key file, including its filename. (It will be stored as `license.key` within your [config/](../directory-structure.md#config) folder by default.)

### `CRAFT_LOG_PHP_ERRORS`

Can be set to `false` to prevent Craft from setting PHP’s [log_errors](http://php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.configuration.php#ini.log-errors) setting, leaving it up to whatever’s set in `php.ini`.

```php
// Don't send PHP error logs to storage/logs/phperrors.log
define('CRAFT_LOG_PHP_ERRORS', false);
```

### `CRAFT_SITE`

The Site handle or ID that Craft should be serving from this `index.php` file. (Only set this if you have a good reason to. Craft will automatically serve the correct site by inspecting the requested URL, unless this is set.)

```php
// Show the German site
define('CRAFT_SITE', 'de');
```

### `CRAFT_STORAGE_PATH`

The path to the [storage/](../directory-structure.md#storage) folder. (It is assumed to live within the base directory by default.)

::: tip
