and any other elements in its collection.










#### `fixedOrder`

::: tip
If no IDs were passed to [id](#id), setting this to `true` will result in an empty result set.
:::



::: code

{% set globalSets = craft.globalSets()
  .id([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
  .fixedOrder()

{% set globalSet = craft.globalSets()
  .id(1)
  .one() %}
```

```php
// Fetch the global set by its ID
$globalSet = \craft\elements\GlobalSet::find()
    ->id(1)
    ->one();
```
:::



::: tip
This can be combined with [fixedOrder](#fixedorder) if you want the results to be returned in a specific order.
:::


#### `ignorePlaceholders`

Causes the query to return matching global sets as they are stored in the database, ignoring matching placeholder
elements that were set by [craft\services\Elements::setPlaceholderElement()](https://docs.craftcms.com/api/v5/craft-services-elements.html#method-setplaceholderelement).

$globalSets = \craft\elements\GlobalSet::find()
    ->inReverse()
    ->all();
```
:::


#### `language`

Determines which site(s) the global sets should be queried in, based on their language.

| `['not', 'en-GB', 'en-US']` | not in sites with a language of `en-GB` or `en-US`.

::: tip
Elements that belong to multiple sites will be returned multiple times by default. If you
only want unique elements to be returned, use [unique](#unique) in conjunction with this.
:::



::: code
```twig
{# Fetch global sets from English sites #}
{% set globalSets = craft.globalSets()
  .language('en')
  .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch global sets from English sites
$globalSets = \craft\elements\GlobalSet::find()
    ->language('en')
    ->all();
```
:::


#### `limit`

    ->limit(10)
    ->all();
```
:::

{# Fetch all global sets that are related to myEntry #}
{% set globalSets = craft.globalSets()
  .notRelatedTo(myEntry)
  .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch all global sets that are related to $myEntry
$globalSets = \craft\elements\GlobalSet::find()

    ->all();
```

$globalSets = \craft\elements\GlobalSet::find()
    ->orderBy('dateCreated ASC')
    ->all();
```
:::


#### `preferSites`

If [unique](#unique) is set, this determines which site should be selected when querying multi-site elements.



For example, if element “Foo” exists in Site A and Site B, and element “Bar” exists in Site B and Site C,
and this is set to `['c', 'b', 'a']`, then Foo will be returned for Site B, and Bar will be returned
for Site C.

If this isn’t set, then preference goes to the current site.



::: code
```twig
{# Fetch unique global sets from Site A, or Site B if they don’t exist in Site A #}
{% set globalSets = craft.globalSets()
  .site('*')
  .unique()
  .preferSites(['a', 'b'])
  .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch unique global sets from Site A, or Site B if they don’t exist in Site A

$globalSets = \craft\elements\GlobalSet::find()
    ->relatedTo($myCategory)
    ->all();
```

#### `search`

Narrows the query results to only global sets that match a search query.



See [Searching](https://craftcms.com/docs/5.x/system/searching.html) for a full explanation of how to work with this parameter.



::: code
```twig
{# Get the search query from the 'q' query string param #}
{% set searchQuery = craft.app.request.getQueryParam('q') %}

{# Fetch all global sets that match the search query #}
{% set globalSets = craft.globalSets()
  .search(searchQuery)

| a [craft\models\Site](craft5:craft\models\Site) object | from the site represented by the object.
| `'*'` | from any site.

::: tip
If multiple sites are specified, elements that belong to multiple sites will be returned multiple times. If you
only want unique elements to be returned, use [unique](#unique) in conjunction with this.
:::



::: code
```twig
{# Fetch global sets from the Foo site #}
{% set globalSets = craft.globalSets()
  .site('foo')
  .all() %}
```

| `['not', 1, 2]` | not with an `elements_sites` ID of 1 or 2.

    ->uid('xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx')
    ->one();
```
:::

This should be used when querying elements from multiple sites at the same time, if “duplicate” results is not
desired.



::: code
```twig
{# Fetch unique global sets across all sites #}
{% set globalSets = craft.globalSets()
  .site('*')
  .unique()
  .all() %}
```

```php

    ->unique()
    ->all();
```
:::
