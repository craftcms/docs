# GraphQL API

Craft Pro provides an autogenerated [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) API for your content, which you can query to pull your content into separate applications, such as single-page apps (SPAs) or static site generators.

## An example query and response

### Query payload

```graphql
{
  entries (section: "news", limit: 2, orderBy: "dateCreated DESC") {
    dateCreated @formatDateTime (format: "Y-m-d")
    title
    children {
      title
    }
    ... on news_article_Entry {
      shortDescription
      featuredImage {
        url @transform (width: 300, immediately: true)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### The response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "entries": [
      {
        "dateCreated": "2019-08-21",
        "title": "An important news item",
        "children": [],
        "shortDescription": "<p>This is how we roll these days.</p>",
        "featuredImage": [
          {
            "url": "/assets/site/_300xAUTO_crop_center-center_none/glasses.jpg"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "dateCreated": "2019-07-02",
        "title": "Dolorem ea eveniet alias",
        "children": [
          {
            "title": "Child entry"
          },
          {
            "title": "This is also a child entry"
          }
        ],
        "shortDescription": "Et omnis explicabo iusto eum nobis. Consequatur debitis architecto est exercitationem vitae velit repellendus. Aut consequatur maiores error ducimus ea et. Rem ipsa asperiores eius quas et omnis. Veniam quasi qui repellendus dignissimos et necessitatibus. Aut a illo tempora.",
        "featuredImage": []
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure that you’re running Craft Pro 3.3 or later and [the `enableGql` setting](config3:enableGql) has not been set to `false`.

### Create Your API Endpoint

The first step to adding a GraphQL API to your project is to set up a public endpoint for it.

To do that, create a [URL rule](routing.md#advanced-routing-with-url-rules) from `config/routes.php` that points to the `graphql/api` controller action. For example, the following URL rule would cause `/api` requests to route to the GraphQL API:

```php
return [
    'api' => 'graphql/api',
    // ...
];
```

You can verify that your endpoint is configured correctly, try sending a `{ping}` query to it.

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/graphql" -d '{ping}' http://my-project.test/api
```

(Replace `http://my-project.test/api` with the actual URL to your endpoint.)

If that comes back with the following JSON response, then your GraphQL API is up and running!

```json
{"data":{"ping":"pong"}}
```

### Define Your Schemas

Once you’ve created a GraphQL API endpoint, you need to tell Craft which content should be available from it. (No content is available by default.) You do that by defining a **Schema**.

Craft has two types of schemas:

- The **Public Schema** defines which content should be available publicly.
- You can also define multiple private schemas, which each have their own secret **Access Token**.

You can manage your schemas from the control panel, at GraphQL → Schemas. In addition to defining the scope of each schema, you can also give them expiration dates, or disable them.

::: tip
When performing a GraphQL API request, the schema will be determined automatically based on the token that is supplied (if any). See [below](#querying-a-private-schema) to learn how to do that.
:::

## Sending API Requests

### Using the GraphiQL IDE

The easiest way to start exploring your GraphQL API is with the built-in [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) IDE, which is available in the control panel from GraphQL → Explore.

### Using Another IDE

Additional GraphQL IDEs are available as well:

* [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)
* [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground)
* [GraphQL Playground online](https://www.graphqlbin.com/v2/new)

::: tip
When you are initially exploring the API, make sure that [Dev Mode](config3:devMode) is enabled so the IDE can be informed about the entire schema available to it.
:::

### Sending Requests Manually

The GraphQL API can be queried in three ways:

- Using a `GET` request, with the GraphQL query defined by a `query` parameter:
  ```bash
  curl \
    --data-urlencode "query={ping}" \
    http://craft32.test/api
  # or
  curl http://craft32.test/api?query=%7Bping%7D
  ```
- Using a `POST` request with an `application/json` content type, with the GraphQL query defined by a `query` key:
  ```bash
  curl \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"query":"{ping}"}' \
    http://my-project.test/api
  ```
- Using a `POST` request with an `application/graphql` content type, with the GraphQL query defined by the raw request body:
  ```bash
  curl \
    -H "Content-Type: application/graphql" \
    -d '{ping}' \
    http://my-project.test/api
  ```

#### Specifying Variables

If you need to specify any [variables](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#variables) along with your query, then you must send request as a `POST` request with an `application/json` content type, and include a `variables` key in the JSON body alongside `query`.

```bash
curl \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "query": "query($id:[Int]) { entries(id: $id) { id, title } }",
        "variables": { "id": [1, 2, 3] }
      }' \
  http://my-project.test/api
```

#### Querying a Private Schema

The Public Schema will be used by default. To query against a different [schema](#define-your-schemas), pass its Access Token using an `Authorization` header.

```bash
curl \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/graphql" \
  -d '{entries{id}}' \
  http://my-project.test/api
```

## Caching

All query results are cached, so that repeated queries can yield results faster. The GraphQL result cache does not have a sophisticated ruleset on invalidating the cache - if the site's content or structure changes, the entire cache is invalidated.

Craft has GraphQL result caching enabled by default, but it can be disabled with the [enableGraphQlCaching](https://docs.craftcms.com/api/v3/craft-config-generalconfig.html#enablegraphqlcaching) config setting.

## Interface Implementation

A defined type exists for each specific interface implementation. For example, if a “News” section has “Article” and “Editorial” entry types, in addition to the `EntryInterface` interface type, two additional types would be defined the GraphQL schema, if the token used allows it: `news_article_Entry` and `news_editorial_Entry` types.

## Query Reference

::: tip
The actual API features will depend on what your schema allows.

## Mutations

::: tip
The actual API features will depend on what your schema allows.
:::

Mutations in GraphQL provide a way of modifying data. The actual mutations will vary depending on the schema. There are some common mutations per GraphQL object type as well as type-specific mutations.

Mutations take the data as arguments and, while for most part they are pretty straightforward, there are a few cases worth mentioning up front.

### Matrix fields in mutations

Due to the limitations of GraphQL, input types are not very flexible and Matrix fields are quite complex. For this reason, they are entitled to their own section in the docs. It is recommended to read up on [how to save matrix field data in entry forms](matrix-fields.md#saving-matrix-fields-in-entry-forms) if you are unfamiliar with that, first.

In general, the Matrix Input types have the same structure:

| Field       | Description                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sortOrder` | A list of all the block IDs that you wish the Matrix field to persist after the mutation in the required order. This include any new blocks.                                            |
| `blocks`    | A list of all the actual blocks. You don't have to include any blocks that are not modified, however, they must be represented on the `sortOrder` field if you don't want them deleted. |

An actual block input type will contain fields for all the possible block types for this field, however, the first non-empty block will be considered in the order that the block types are defined on the field.

Let's look at an example.

Let's say you have a Matrix field with a handle `documentationField`. The field has two block types - `screenshot` and `paragraph`. The following is a list of all the input types generated for this Matrix field.

| Type name                                        | Type Description                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `documentationField_MatrixInput`                 | This is the input type for the Matrix field. As discussed above, it will contain two fields: `sortOrder` and `blocks`.   |
| `documentationField_MatrixBlockContainerInput`   | This is the input type that represents the block. In this case it will contain two fields: `screenshot` and `paragraph`. |
| `documentationField_screenshot_MatrixBlockInput` | This is the input type for the `screenshot` block. It will contain all the fields defined for that block type.           |
| `documentationField_paragraph_MatrixBlockInput`  | In a similar fashion, this is the input type for the `paragraph` block.                                                  |

In GraphQL SDL it would look like this:

```graphql
input docunentationField_MatrixInput {
  sortOrder: [QueryArgument]!
  blocks: [documentationField_MatrixBlockContainerInput]
}

input documentationField_MatrixBlockContainerInput {
  screenshot: documentationField_screenshot_MatrixBlockInput
  paragraph: documentationField_paragraph_MatrixBlockInput
}

input documentationField_screenshot_MatrixBlockInput {
  # List of content fields defined for this block type
}

input documentationField_paragraph_MatrixBlockInput {
  # List of content fields defined for this block type
}
```

Tw submit two blocks, the `blocks` would contain a list of two input objects of the `documentationField_MatrixBlockContainerInput` input type. What field on those objects would contain data would determine the final block type. If more than one of the block types are defined, only the block type that is listed first will be considered.

### Uploading files via mutations

There are currently two ways to do a file upload - you can pass in a URL to the file that will be downloaded to the server or you can pass along the file data encoded in Base64. Either way, wherever you're able to upload a file, you will have to use the `FileInput` GraphQL input type. It has the following fields.

| Field      | Description                                                                                     |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fileData` | The contents of the file in Base64 format. If provided, takes precedence over the URL.          |
| `filename` | The filename to use for the file. If not present, Craft will figure out a filename on it's own. |
| `url`      | The URL of the file to use                                                                      |

### Mutating entries

#### Saving an entry

To save an entry use the entry type-specific mutation which will have the name in the form of `save_<sectionHandle>_<entryTypeHandle>_Entry`.

<!-- BEGIN ENTRY MUTATION ARGS -->

| Argument     | Type       | Description                                                                             |
| ------------ | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`         | `ID`       | Set the element’s ID.                                                                   |
| `uid`        | `String`   | Set the element’s UID.                                                                  |
| `title`      | `String`   | The title of the element.                                                               |
| `enabled`    | `Boolean`  | Whether the element should be enabled.                                                  |
| `authorId`   | `ID`       | The ID of the user that created this entry.                                             |
| `postDate`   | `DateTime` | When should the entry be posted.                                                        |
| `expiryDate` | `DateTime` | When should the entry expire.                                                           |
| `slug`       | `String`   | Narrows the query results based on the elements’ slugs.                                 |
| `siteId`     | `Int`      | Determines which site(s) the elements should be saved to. Defaults to the primary site. |
| `...`        |            | More arguments depending on the field layout for the type                               |

<!-- END ENTRY MUTATION ARGS -->

The `id`, `uid` and `authorId` arguments do no exist for single entries. This is because single entries have no authors and are identified already by the exact mutation. In a similar fashion, there are additional arguments available for structured entries. For more information, refer to [mutating structure data](#mutating-structure-data)

#### Saving a draft

To save a draft for an entry use the entry type-specific mutation which will have the name in the form of `save_<sectionHandle>_<entryTypeHandle>_Draft`.

<!-- BEGIN DRAFT MUTATION ARGS -->
