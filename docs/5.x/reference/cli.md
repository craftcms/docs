# Console Commands

<Todo notes="Split into controllers?" />

The complete list of available commands will include those from any plugins or custom modules youâ€™ve added to your project. Only those that are present by default in all Craft installations are listed below.

::: tip
Run `ddev craft help` to see a list of commands your project supports.

### Global Options

All commands support the following options:

`--color`
: Explicitly enable or disable ANSI coloring in output. When omitted, color will only be used in environments that support it.

`--help`
: Displays help about the command, rather than running it. Alternative to `php craft help controller/action`.

`--interactive`
: Enable or disable interactive prompts for the command. When using the CLI in unattended or automated workflows (like CRON or deployments), consider setting `--interactive=0`.

`--isolated`
: Acquire a [mutex lock](yii2:yii\mutex\Mutex) before running the command to prevent simultaneous execution. Some commands (like `migrate` and `project-config`) have their own internal locking mechanism.

`--silent-exit-on-exception`
: Force a nominal exit code (`0`), even if an exception occurred. Useful when inconsequential failures would otherwise block chained commands in automated environments.
