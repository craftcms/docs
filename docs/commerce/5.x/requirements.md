# Requirements

Craft Commerce requires Craft <Badge type="edition" text="Pro" vertical="middle" />, and therefore shares [its requirements](../../5.x/requirements.md). Your environment must also support PHP’s [SOAP extension](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.soap.php).

If you encounter Composer errors during installation, you can verify SOAP is installed and enabled by vising <Journey path="Settings, Utilities, PHP Info" /> in the Craft control panel.

::: tip
If you’re using MySQL or MariaDB, the engine should provide timezone support for the best experience. See [Populating MySQL and MariaDB Timezone Tables](kb:populating-mysql-mariadb-timezone-tables).
