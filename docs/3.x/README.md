# About Craft CMS

It features:

- A clean-slate approach to content modeling and [front-end development](dev/README.md) that doesn’t make any assumptions about your content or how it should be consumed.
- A built-in Plugin Store with hundreds of free and commercial [plugins](https://plugins.craftcms.com/), all just a click away.
- A robust framework for [module and plugin development](extend/README.md).
- An active, vibrant [community](https://craftcms.com/community).

You can learn all about it at [craftcms.com](https://craftcms.com).

## Tech Specs
