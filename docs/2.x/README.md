# About Craft CMS

Craft is a content management system (CMS) that’s laser-focused on doing one thing really, really well: *managing content*. And since content comes in all shapes and sizes, we’ve built Craft to be as flexible as possible, without compromising on the ease of use for content authors.

## Who it’s For

Craft is for folks who like to take their time and do things right, building out their HTML, CSS, and JS by hand. This is not a site builder or some sort of design tool. There are no themes, and you won’t find any flashy UI tools full of sliders and other gadgets that will help you “design” your website in minutes.

## What it’s For

Craft was built to be exceptionally scalable, to the point that even its own feature set can adapt to the scope of the project. Whether you’re building a portfolio site or a big corporate site, Craft is a great choice.

## Tech Specs

Craft is a self-hosted PHP application built on [Yii](https://www.yiiframework.com/), but you don’t need to know PHP or Yii to use it. Check out [requirements](requirements.md) for a full list of browser and server requirements.
