{% set tags = craft.tags()
  .language('en')
  .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch tags from English sites
$tags = \craft\elements\Tag::find()
    ->language('en')
    ->all();
```
:::

$tags = \craft\elements\Tag::find()
    ->orderBy('dateCreated ASC')
    ->all();
```
:::


#### `preferSites`

If [unique](#unique) is set, this determines which site should be selected when querying multi-site elements.



For example, if element “Foo” exists in Site A and Site B, and element “Bar” exists in Site B and Site C,

for Site C.

If this isn’t set, then preference goes to the current site.



::: code
```twig
{# Fetch unique tags from Site A, or Site B if they don’t exist in Site A #}
{% set tags = craft.tags()
  .site('*')
  .unique()
  .preferSites(['a', 'b'])
  .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch unique tags from Site A, or Site B if they don’t exist in Site A

{% set tags = craft.tags()
  .search(searchQuery)
  .all() %}
```

::: tip
If multiple sites are specified, elements that belong to multiple sites will be returned multiple times. If you
only want unique elements to be returned, use [unique](#unique) in conjunction with this.
:::



::: code
```twig
{# Fetch tags from the Foo site #}
{% set tags = craft.tags()
  .site('foo')
  .all() %}
